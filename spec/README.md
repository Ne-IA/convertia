# ConvertIA — Technical Specification

> The complete technical specification for ConvertIA, derived from the
> [Single Source of Truth](../SINGLE-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) (SSOT). The SSOT remains
> authoritative on **what & why**; this spec defines **how**.

## Status & rules of engagement

- **Living document.** Unlike the SSOT, this spec is expected to be refined and
  referenced *during* development — sections get adjusted as implementation
  reveals detail. The SSOT does **not** change for that; it stays the single
  source of truth.
- **Conflict rule:** if the spec ever contradicts the SSOT, the **SSOT wins** and
  the spec is corrected.
- **Derivation:** Phase 3 (the implementation TODO/plan) is derived from this
  spec, so it must be **complete** — every behaviour the SSOT promises has a
  technical home here.
- **Scope:** technical specification of the *software*. **Out of scope:**
  distribution/store logistics, developer accounts, code-signing/notarization
  processes (see SSOT *Explicitly Out of Scope*) — **except** where they impose an
  in-code requirement (e.g. generating an SBOM, producing release checksums).

## Structure / reading order

| # | File | Covers (SSOT origin) | Maps to A/B/C/D |
|---|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 00 | [architecture](00-architecture.md) | System architecture, Tauri model, IPC, project layout, domain model, tech stack | **A** |
| 01 | [conversion-pipeline](01-conversion-pipeline.md) | Detection, queue, batch rules, job lifecycle, engine-invocation model, progress, cancellation | **B** |
| 02 | [guarantees](02-guarantees.md) | Implementation of the SSOT hard guarantees (no-harm, atomicity, fail-clearly, output destination, security/isolation) | **B** |
| 03 | [engines-and-bundling](03-engines-and-bundling.md) | Engine registry/selection, bundling (all offline), per-platform packaging, licence surfacing (NOTICE/SBOM) | **B** |
| 04 | [formats/](04-formats/README.md) | Per-category format matrix — detection, targets (both directions), engine, options, lossy notes | **C** |
| 05 | [ui-ux](05-ui-ux.md) | Frontend architecture, screen states, components, design system, accessibility, IPC integration | **D** |
| 06 | [build-test-release](06-build-test-release.md) | Build matrix, checksums/releases, SBOM, repo-policy artifacts, release gates, test strategy & real-world corpus | A+B+C+D (spans all) |
| 07 | [app-shell](07-app-shell.md) | ConvertIA as a running app: instance/run identity, lifecycle, persistence, logging, update posture | **A** |

_Legend — **A** Architecture & app shell · **B** Core engine & guarantees · **C** Format coverage · **D** UI (these are the Phase-1 A/B/C/D buckets; 06 spans all). **Read 00 and 07 together** — 07 is A-track foundational despite its file number._

## Conventions

- **Decision tags:** `[DECIDED]` (fixed here / by the SSOT), `[OPEN]` (needs a
  call — collected in the log below), `[DEFER]` (resolved during implementation).
- **SSOT references** by section *name* (e.g. *Never harm the original*).
- Code/identifiers in English; this doc in English (public OSS repo).

## Parked decisions inherited from Phase 1 (the "how" seeds)

- **Framework:** Tauri (Rust core + React/TS/Tailwind/Vite UI). `[DECIDED]`
- **Engine delivery:** bundle **everything**, fully offline, no runtime fetch. `[DECIDED]`
- **Licensing mechanism:** copyleft engines shipped as **separate, independently
  invoked binaries** (aggregation, not linking) so the MIT core stays clean;
  NOTICE/third-party-licenses + SBOM. `[DECIDED]`

## Open-questions log

> Running list of `[OPEN]` items surfaced while writing the spec; resolved items
> move to `[DECIDED]` with a one-line rationale.

- **HEIC / AAC / H.264 patent disposition** — per format × platform: ship bundled / gate / rely-on-OS / unavailable (MP4-as-default video target depends on H.264/AAC shipping on all 3 platforms). Owner: §3.4. `[OPEN]`
- **Rust↔TS type-sharing mechanism** — manual mirror vs codegen (ts-rs / specta / tauri-specta). Owner: §0.4. `[OPEN]`
- **Instance & run identity** — single vs multi-instance; run/instance id model. Owner: §7.1. `[OPEN]`
- **Persistence** — does v1 persist anything (last destination / theme / window) or nothing? Owner: §7.4. `[OPEN]`
- **Logging** — local log yes/no, location, redaction stance. Owner: §7.5. `[OPEN]`
- **extract-audio target subset** — which audio targets are offered from a video source. Owner: 04-formats/cross-category. `[OPEN]`
- **to-GIF option scope** — trim / fps / size in v1? Owner: 04-formats/cross-category. `[OPEN]`
