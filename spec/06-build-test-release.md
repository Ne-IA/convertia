# 06 — Build, Test & Release

> The technical build/test/release pipeline (software-side only — no store/account
> logistics). Origin: SSOT *v1 Definition of Done*, *Distribution & download
> trust*, *Cross-platform, one product*, *Local/private/offline*, *Engine-license

> **This section spans all four tracks (A+B+C+D).** It does not re-own pipeline,

> - The engine inventory, per-platform packaging, the patent matrix and the
>   NOTICE/SBOM **data generation** are owned by §3 (§3.1, §3.3, §3.4, §3.6, §3.7,
>   §3.8, §3.9). This file owns *when* those run in CI and *that* they gate a release.
> - The hard guarantees under test (no-harm, atomicity, fail-clearly, isolation)
>   are owned by §2. This file owns the **test harness** that proves them.
> - The IPC surface under integration test is owned by §0.4; the Rust↔TS type
>   drift-check tooling is owned by §0.4.5; this file runs the check in CI.
> - The per-pair format facts (engines, defaults, lossy flags) are owned by §04;
>   this file consumes them as the **conversion matrix under test**.
> - The UI flow under the usability-floor walkthrough is owned by §5; the
>   instance/run/log model the tests rely on is owned by §7.

Decision tags: `[DECIDED]` (fixed here or by the SSOT), `[OPEN]` (needs an
owner-level call — fed to the README open-questions log), `[DEFER]` (resolved
during implementation). Recommended defaults for easy `[OPEN]`s are marked
**(recommendation)**.

## 6.1 Build matrix `[DECIDED — native-per-platform; artifact formats recommended]`

### 6.1.1 The hard constraint: no meaningful cross-compilation

Tauri links the **native system WebView** (WebView2 / WKWebView / WebKitGTK,
§0.3.1) and ConvertIA bundles **native engine binaries per platform** (FFmpeg,
LibreOffice, libvips, poppler, pandoc, … — §3.1/§3.3). Both make cross-compilation
impractical: Tauri's own guidance is that cross-compiling desktop bundles is not
supported in practice, and our copyleft engines ship as **separate per-OS
binaries** that must themselves be obtained/built for each target. **Decision:
build each platform on its own native CI runner.** No cross-compile; the matrix is
three independent native legs that fan in to one release. This is the documented
Tauri-recommended path (compile per platform on CI).

### 6.1.2 The artifact-per-platform table

One product, **one primary artifact per platform** (SSOT *Cross-platform, one
product*). SSOT *Portable, no installation* / *no system pollution* makes the
**portable / no-installer** variant the canonical download where one exists; an
installer variant is offered only where it is the platform norm and does not
require admin rights for the user to run.

| Platform | Tauri bundle target(s) | Canonical download (portable-first) | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| **Windows x64** | `nsis` (+ optionally the raw `.exe`) | **Portable single `.exe`** is the canonical "download, run, done" artifact. NSIS is offered as a convenience installer that can run **per-user / no-admin** (`installMode: currentUser`). | MSI (`wix`) is **not** used — it implies a system install / admin. `[OPEN-6.1a]` whether to ship NSIS at all vs portable-exe-only. **(recommendation: ship the portable `.exe` as primary, NSIS per-user as a secondary convenience.)** |
| **macOS (universal)** | `app` (inside) → `dmg` | **`.dmg`** containing a **universal** `ConvertIA.app` (arm64 + x86_64 via `--target universal-apple-darwin`). | One universal artifact covers Apple-Silicon and Intel → honours "one product per platform". Unsigned/unnotarized (SSOT *Out of Scope*) → first-launch Gatekeeper friction is documented on the download page (§6.2.4) and About (§5.9). |
| **Linux x64** | `appimage` (+ optionally `deb`) | **AppImage** — the portable, distro-agnostic, no-install, runs-anywhere artifact (matches SSOT portability best). | `.deb`/`.rpm` are distro-specific *installs* (system pollution); they are **secondary at most**. `[OPEN-6.1b]` whether to also publish a `.deb`. **(recommendation: AppImage-only for v1; revisit `.deb` by demand.)** |

ARM Windows and ARM Linux are **out of v1** (SSOT platform scope = Win/macOS/Linux
desktop; no commitment to every CPU arch). `[OPEN-6.1c]` Linux arm64 / Windows
arm64 — deferred, low demand. The supported-OS floor (minimum Windows/macOS/distro
versions, WebView availability) is **owned by §0.3.1** and referenced by the
release notes; it is not re-decided here.

### 6.1.3 How engines bundle per platform (process, not policy)

§3.3 owns the bundling model and §3.4 the patent matrix; **this file owns the
build-time mechanics that realise them**:

- Copyleft engines (FFmpeg, LibreOffice, poppler, pandoc, Ghostscript-if-shipped)
  are **separate invoked binaries** (§3.6). They are placed under
  `src-tauri/binaries/` (sidecars) and/or `src-tauri/resources/` (engine support
  trees like the LibreOffice program dir + the bundled font set, §3 / documents.md
  fonts `[OPEN]`), and declared in `tauri.conf.json`:
  - **Sidecars** → `bundle.externalBin`. Tauri requires each sidecar to exist as
    `name-<target-triple>[.exe]` (e.g. `ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe`,
    `ffmpeg-aarch64-apple-darwin`); a small build script (`scripts/stage-engines.*`,
    run before `tauri build`) stages and target-triple-suffixes each binary for the
    runner's host triple. For the macOS **universal** build, both arch slices must
    be present (each sidecar staged for both triples, or itself a `lipo`-merged
    universal Mach-O).
  - **Engine support files** (non-executable: LibreOffice's `share/`, `program/`
    libs, fonts, pandoc data) → `bundle.resources`, resolved at runtime via the
    Tauri resource path (§3.5 owns the working-dir/env wiring; §7.2 owns startup
    presence-verification of these files).
- The whole engine set is **vendored into the build inputs** — never fetched at
  runtime (SSOT offline floor) and, per the supply-chain stance (§6.3.4),
  **pinned by version + checksum**, ideally not fetched at build time from a live
  network either (a local/cached engine artifact store). `[OPEN-6.1d]` exact
  engine-acquisition mechanism for CI (vendored in-repo via Git LFS vs a pinned
  release-asset cache vs a reproducible build-from-source step). The **size budget**
  this implies is owned by §3.9. **(recommendation: a pinned, checksum-verified
  engine-asset cache keyed by engine version; not committed raw into Git.)**
- A platform's artifact ships **only the engines available on that platform per
  §3.4**. A patent-gapped engine (e.g. an HEVC encoder absent on a platform) is
  simply not staged there; the affected target is surfaced as unavailable in the UI
  (§5.2, sourced from §3.4) — **never a silent omission** (SSOT *v1 DoD* exception 1).

### 6.1.4 CI runners

| Leg | Runner | Toolchain installed | Platform-specific deps |
|-----|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Windows | `windows-latest` (x64) | Rust (MSVC host triple), Node + pnpm | WebView2 is preinstalled on supported Windows; **not** bundled (no-network forbids downloading it at runtime — §0.3.1 owns the floor). NSIS provided by tauri-cli. |
| macOS | `macos-latest` (Apple Silicon) building `universal-apple-darwin` | Rust with both `aarch64-apple-darwin` + `x86_64-apple-darwin` targets, Node + pnpm | Xcode CLT for `lipo`/codesign-less packaging. No notarization step (out of scope). |
| Linux | `ubuntu-latest` (pin a specific LTS for glibc floor stability) | Rust, Node + pnpm | `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libappindicator`, `librsvg2-dev`, `patchelf`, `libfuse2` (AppImage). **glibc of the build image sets the minimum Linux version** — pin an older Ubuntu LTS to maximise compatibility; documented in §0.3.1's floor. |

The platform CI standard (`reference_self_hosted_ci_runner.md`) runs a **self-hosted
VPS runner** for the Ne-IA org's existing four projects. ConvertIA's build matrix
**cannot** reuse a single Linux VPS runner for all three legs (no native macOS/Windows
there). `[OPEN-6.1e]` use **GitHub-hosted** runners for the macOS/Windows legs
(matching upstream Tauri guidance; spends Actions minutes — weigh against the
platform's hobby/no-paid-upgrades budget, `user_hobby_budget_no_paid_upgrades.md`)
vs self-hosting mac/win runners. **(recommendation: GitHub-hosted for mac/win, the
self-hosted Linux runner for the Linux leg + the lint/test gate; release builds are
infrequent — one-large-all-or-nothing v1, SSOT — so minute spend is bounded.)**

---

## 6.2 Reproducibility & integrity `[DECIDED — published hashes; reproducibility = best-effort intent]`

### 6.2.1 Why this matters (SSOT)

Signing/notarization is **deliberately out of scope** (SSOT *Out of Scope*), so the
**stated trust substitute** is *published integrity hashes from one canonical
location*. This is the only protection a user has that a download is authentic, so
it is treated as a **release gate**, not an afterthought.

### 6.2.2 Canonical location `[DECIDED]`

Releases are published **only** from the **Ne-IA org's GitHub Releases**
(`github.com/Ne-IA/convertia/releases`) — the single source of authentic builds
(SSOT *Distribution & download trust*). No mirror, no third-party host is endorsed.
The README/download page states this explicitly.

### 6.2.3 Hashes & manifest `[DECIDED]`

For **every** published artifact:
- A **SHA-256** is computed in CI immediately after the artifact is built (before
  upload) and published as:
  - a per-file `<artifact>.sha256` sidecar, **and**
  - a single signed-by-content `SHA256SUMS` manifest covering all artifacts of the
    release (the familiar `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` workflow).
- The **SBOM** (§6.3) and the **`SHA256SUMS`** are themselves release assets.
- `[OPEN-6.2a]` whether to additionally publish a **minisign / GPG detached
  signature over `SHA256SUMS`** — note this is *not* code-signing the binary (out of
  scope) but signing the *checksum manifest*, which materially strengthens the trust
  substitute at near-zero cost and stays within "no store/cert" scope.
  **(recommendation: yes — a project minisign key over `SHA256SUMS`, public key in
  the repo; it closes the "attacker replaces both the artifact and its hash" gap
  that bare checksums don't.)** Tracked in the open-questions log because it touches
  the SSOT trust posture.

### 6.2.4 How a user verifies (must be surfaced) `[DECIDED]`

The download page and README give a copy-paste verification recipe **at the
highest-risk moment** (SSOT):
- Windows (PowerShell): `Get-FileHash .\ConvertIA.exe -Algorithm SHA256` → compare
  to the published value.
- macOS/Linux: `shasum -a 256 ConvertIA.dmg` / `sha256sum ConvertIA.AppImage`, or
  `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.
- If §6.2.3's signature ships: `minisign -Vm SHA256SUMS -P <pubkey>`.
The page also restates the **as-is / no-warranty / best-effort-security** posture
(SSOT *License & Openness*), and the unsigned-build first-launch friction per OS
(Gatekeeper on macOS, SmartScreen on Windows) so a normal user isn't surprised.

### 6.2.5 Reproducible-build intent `[OPEN — best-effort, not a gate]`

Full bit-for-bit reproducibility across the Rust+WebView+vendored-engine artifact
is **hard** (timestamps, build-paths, per-runner toolchain drift, the prebuilt
engine binaries we don't compile ourselves). v1 stance: **reproducibility is a
best-effort intent, explicitly NOT a release gate** (mirrors the SSOT
engine-currency "best-effort, not a gate" posture). Cheap measures we *do* take:
pinned toolchains (§0.8), pinned engine versions+checksums (§3.8/§6.1.3),
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` where the toolchain honours it, and recording the exact
toolchain/engine versions in the SBOM so a build is at least **auditable** even if
not bit-reproducible. `[OPEN-6.2b]` how far to pursue determinism — deferred.

---

## 6.3 SBOM & licence artifacts `[DECIDED — attribution is a release gate]`

> §3.7 **owns the generation** of the NOTICE/third-party-licenses **data** and the
> SBOM source. §5.9 **displays** the NOTICE in-app. **This file owns** the CI
> assembly step and the **completeness gate**: a missing or incorrect attribution
> is **release-blocking — same status as the no-harm guarantee** (SSOT *v1 DoD*).

### 6.3.1 What "the SBOM" actually covers (two layers)

ConvertIA's bill of materials is **not** just its Rust crate graph — the
load-bearing licence risk is the **bundled engine binaries** (FFmpeg LGPL,
LibreOffice MPL, poppler/pandoc/Ghostscript GPL/AGPL, libvips LGPL, x265 GPL, …).
So the SBOM is assembled in **two layers**:

| Layer | Contents | Tool |
|-------|----------|------|
| **App dependency graph** | Rust crates (`Cargo.lock`) + JS deps (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) that compose ConvertIA's own MIT code | **`cargo cyclonedx`** for Rust; an npm/pnpm CycloneDX generator for the frontend; merged into one CycloneDX document. |
| **Bundled engines (the important layer)** | Every separately-invoked engine binary + its support libs/fonts, each as an SBOM component with **name, version, licence (SPDX id), source URL, and the per-platform availability** | A **manually-maintained `engines.lock` manifest** (owned/sourced by §3.1/§3.8) is the authoritative input; CI converts it into CycloneDX components and merges with the dependency-graph layer. Optionally **Syft** scans the staged bundle to *cross-check* that nothing in the shipped tree is missing from the manifest (drift detection). |

Output format: **CycloneDX JSON** as the canonical SBOM (developer-friendly,
good licence+component fidelity); a **CycloneDX→SPDX** export is generated too if a
consumer needs the ISO-standard form. Both are release assets.

### 6.3.2 NOTICE / third-party-licenses assembly

- The repo `NOTICE` (and a longer `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt`) is **generated from
  the same `engines.lock` + dependency SBOM** so it can never silently drift from
  what actually ships. It contains, per bundled engine: the engine name+version,
  its full licence text, and — for **GPL/LGPL/AGPL** engines — the required
  **written offer of source** (where the corresponding source can be obtained:
  the pinned upstream tag + our build recipe), honouring §3.6's copyleft
  obligations.
- The in-app About screen (§5.9) presents this listing; the file in the repo and
  the in-bundle copy are the **same generated artifact** (one source of truth).

### 6.3.3 The completeness gate (release-blocking) `[DECIDED]`

CI runs an **attribution-completeness check** and **fails the release** if it does
not pass. Concretely:
1. **Every** binary/resource staged into the bundle (§6.1.3) maps to a component in
   `engines.lock` (Syft cross-check from 6.3.1 — *no shipped file without an SBOM
   entry*).
2. **Every** SBOM component with a copyleft licence (GPL/LGPL/MPL/AGPL) has its
   licence text present in `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` **and** (for GPL-family) a
   written-offer-of-source entry.
3. **No** component is missing a resolved SPDX licence id (an `UNKNOWN`/`NOASSERTION`
   licence is a hard fail — forces a human to classify it before ship).
4. **No** engine whose licence is *incompatible with inbound-MIT-clean distribution
   as a separate binary* slipped in (policy: copyleft is fine **as an aggregated
   separate binary**; anything that would taint the MIT core via linking is rejected
   — this is a guardrail on §3.6, surfaced as a CI assertion).
This check is part of the **release pipeline** (§6.7), not the per-PR fast lane, and
its failure blocks artifact publication exactly like a failed no-harm property test.

### 6.3.4 Supply-chain hygiene (the bundled-binary surface)

Per §0.11's threat map (*bundled-binary supply chain → §3.8/§6.3*): the pinned
engine versions+checksums (§6.1.3) are verified at stage time; `cargo audit` /
`cargo deny` run in CI over the Rust graph (advisory + licence-policy enforcement,
non-release-blocking advisory-wise but licence-policy-blocking). Engine
**currency** (keeping decoders patched) is a **best-effort posture, not a gate**
(SSOT) — owned by §3.8; this file only ensures a bumped engine is re-validated
against the corpus (§6.4/§6.5) before it can ship.

---

## 6.4 Test strategy `[DECIDED]`

The DoD bar — *"works reliably"* = passes **fail-clearly (§2.8)** and **no-harm
(§2.5)** on a **representative real-world corpus** — is operationalised as a layered
test suite. Layers, from cheapest/most-frequent to most-expensive:

### 6.4.1 Unit tests — Rust core (the guarantees layer)

Pure-logic tests on the §0.7 modules, **no engines, no real FS where avoidable**:
- **Output naming contract (§2.2):** base-name-kept + target-extension; `(1)`/`(2)`
  numbering before the extension; never hashed / `_converted`; path-limit →
  fail-clearly (no truncation). Property-tested with adversarial names (Unicode,
  emoji, RTL, spaces, dots, max-length).
- **No-clobber & resolved identity (§2.1/§2.3):** exclusive-create semantics;
  symlink/junction/hardlink resolution; de-dup of the frozen set by resolved
  identity; refusal to write through a link onto a frozen source.
- **Frozen source set (§2.4):** files appearing after the freeze are never ingested;
  outputs in a source folder don't expand the batch.
- **Re-run/equivalence (§2.5):** equality on (resolved source + target + effective
  settings); safe fallback to silent numbering when undeterminable.
- **Detection (§1.2):** magic-byte classification table — every signature in §04
  (JPEG SOI, PNG, RIFF/WEBP, EBML DocType matroska-vs-webm, ISO-BMFF `ftyp`
  brand, OLE2-stream disambiguation DOC/XLS/PPT, ZIP-OPC content-type
  DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/ODF-mimetype, ADTS-vs-MP3, Ogg codec-id Vorbis-vs-Opus, ASF GUID
  WMA-vs-WMV, text/CSV-TSV delimiter sniff) gets a fixture asserting the correct
  user-facing type, **including misnamed-extension fixtures** (`.jpg` that is PNG;
  `.m4a` that is ALAC) and the "detected-but-unsupported" / "uncertain" outcomes.
- **Batch grouping (§1.3):** one-source-format-per-batch; mixed-drop pre-flight
  refusal lists the found formats; cross-category targets attach to the *source*.
- **Target resolution (§1.5) + defaults registry (§1.6):** for **every** source
  format in §04, exactly **one** pre-highlighted default; the "no required choices"
  invariant (drop → default → convert needs zero clicks) is asserted against the
  consolidated defaults registry §1.6 may own.
- **Error taxonomy mapping (§2.8/§2.13):** each failure kind maps to its catalog
  string; worker-thread panic boundary (`catch_unwind`) surfaces a clean per-item
  failure, not a poisoned pool.

### 6.4.2 Property / fault-injection tests (no-harm + fail-clearly, hardened)

These directly defend the SSOT hard promises and run with a real (temp) filesystem
and stub/real engines:
- **Atomicity under interruption (§2.1):** a conversion killed mid-write (simulated
  crash/force-quit/cancel) **never** leaves a truncated visible file — only a
  discardable temp artifact, cleaned on next run (§2.6). Cross-volume path
  (source on USB → output in Downloads, §2.14) exercised: copy→fsync→atomic-rename
  *within* the destination volume.
- **No-harm fuzz:** randomized batches over the corpus assert **source bytes are
  byte-identical before/after** every run (originals never touched), including the
  same-source==same-target re-encode case (§2.1) and the divert/fallback path
  (§2.7) (guarantees hold identically there).
- **Out-of-disk / too-big (§1.10/§2.8):** a constrained-FS harness proves the item
  fails fast+clearly, the batch continues, and free space returns to ~baseline
  (§2.6); a cleanup that itself fails is **never** reported as a clean success.
- **Malformed/adversarial inputs (§2.12/§2.13):** truncated, 0-byte, fuzzed-header,
  encrypted/DRM (password PDF/XLSX/PPTX, FairPlay M4V, PlaysForSure WMV), and
  decompression-bomb-shaped inputs each produce **one plain message**, no crash, no
  app wedge, batch continues. The decoder runs inside the §2.12 isolation boundary;
  these tests verify a hanging/crashing engine fails **one** item.
- **Cancellation (§1.7/§1.11):** mid-batch cancel keeps finished items, discards the
  in-flight one with no partial leftover, never touches originals.

### 6.4.3 Integration tests — per-pair conversions (the real engines)

The heart of the reliability gate (§6.5). For **every** (source→target) pair
enumerated across §04 (the matrices in images/audio/video/documents/spreadsheets/
presentations + cross-category extract-audio/to-GIF), against the §6.4.5 corpus:
- the conversion **completes** with exit success and produces a **valid file of the
  target format** (validated by re-detecting the output's magic bytes via §1.2, and
  a format-appropriate structural check — e.g. `ffprobe` the audio/video output is
  decodable; the image decodes and has expected dimensions; `pdftotext`/poppler can
  open the produced PDF; the CSV round-trips field counts);
- the **content-fidelity** spot-checks pass: CJK/RTL text survives doc/sheet/slide
  conversions (§2.10); image orientation is baked upright (§04 images); audio
  tags/cover-art round-trip where the target supports them (§04 audio); video
  remux-vs-reencode chose the lossless path when codecs already fit (§04 video);
- the **lossy disclosure** is asserted to fire **iff** the pair is flagged lossy in
  §04 (and, for video, based on the *planned* remux-vs-reencode disposition, not the
  static pair) — the §2.9 catalog string is shown for exactly the flagged cases.
- **Patent-gapped pairs (§3.4):** on a platform where §3.4 marks a target
  unavailable, the integration test asserts the target is **absent/disabled** (not
  attempted) rather than failing — honest unavailability, not a test failure.

### 6.4.4 Cross-platform test runs

The integration + property suites run on **all three native CI legs** (§6.1.4) —
the reliability bar is *per-platform* (SSOT: "on all three platforms"). Additional
platform-specific concerns:
- **WebView rendering drift (§0.3.1):** a light UI smoke test (the §6.4.6
  Playwright/WebDriver flow) runs on each platform to catch WebView2/WKWebView/
  WebKitGTK layout/behaviour differences in the core flow.
- **macOS TCC** file-access prompts that the beside-source default can trigger
  (§7.2) are exercised in the macOS leg's headed smoke run.
- **LibreOffice headless is NOT safely parallel** (§0.9) — the office-pair
  integration tests must run LibreOffice **serialized**; the harness honours the
  §0.9 concurrency-degree config so the test environment matches production.

### 6.4.5 The real-world input corpus (concrete contents) `[DECIDED — required v1 asset]`

The corpus is a **required v1 asset and a precondition for declaring any pair done**
(SSOT) — without it the reliability gate is circular. It lives in the repo (or an
LFS/release-asset store if size demands) under `tests/corpus/`, **organised by
source format**, with a `manifest.toml` recording for each file: source format,
provenance/licence (corpus files must themselves be redistributable — public-domain
/ CC0 / self-produced / synthetic), the **properties it is chosen to exercise**, and
the **expected outcome** per target (success / specific fail-clearly kind / specific
lossy note). Concrete required contents:

**Images** (`tests/corpus/images/`)
- Real **iPhone HEIC** photos (HDR, 10-bit, with EXIF orientation tags 1/3/6/8, GPS,
  ICC Display-P3) — the canonical HEIC→JPG everyday case + orientation-bake + ICC.
- **JPEG** with EXIF orientation, progressive, CMYK, 12-bit, truncated-tail.
- **PNG** RGBA, 16-bit, palette, **APNG** (animation-collapse case).
- **WEBP** lossy, lossless, **animated**, with alpha.
- **AVIF** still + **animated (`avis`)**, HDR/wide-gamut.
- **GIF** static + multi-frame **animated** (first-frame-collapse + passthrough).
- **TIFF** multi-page, 16-bit, CMYK, big-endian; **BMP** 24/32-bit, top-down/bottom-up.
- **ICO** multi-resolution (16/32/48/256) + non-square (padding case).
- **SVG** with intrinsic size, viewBox-only, missing-font, `.svgz`, a **remote
  `<image href>`** (must NOT be fetched — offline/security assertion), and a
  pathological tiny-viewBox-huge-render (must fail-clearly, not OOM).

**Audio** (`tests/corpus/audio/`)
- One file per source format (MP3 incl. VBR/CBR + ID3v2 + cover art; WAV 16/24/float;
  FLAC with Vorbis comments + cover; raw-ADTS `.aac`; **M4A holding AAC** *and* a
  separate **M4A holding ALAC** — the detection-by-codec case; OGG-Vorbis;
  `.opus`; AIFF; WMA v2/Pro/Lossless).
- Multichannel (5.1) source (channel-preservation, no silent downmix).
- A **>16-bit source** (bit-depth-reduction-to-default-16-bit disclosure case).
- Files with **non-Latin/CJK/RTL tag text** (tag fidelity, §2.10).
- Corrupt/truncated + 0-byte + a `.mp3` that is really FLAC (mislabel) cases.

**Video** (`tests/corpus/video/`) — short clips (a few seconds) to keep runtime sane:
- **MP4 (H.264+AAC)** → the lossless-remux baseline; **MOV from iPhone (HEVC)** →
  the §04 HEVC-default `[OPEN]` case; **MKV** with **multiple audio tracks + SRT +
  ASS + PGS subtitles + chapters + font attachments** (the keep/convert/drop policy);
  **WEBM (VP9+Opus, and a VP8 alpha clip)**; legacy **AVI (DivX+MP3)**, **WMV
  (VC-1+WMA)**, **FLV (H.264/AAC and old Sorenson)**, **MPG (interlaced MPEG-2 +
  AC-3 — deinterlace case)**, **M4V (DRM-free)**, **3GP (H.263+AMR-NB)**.
- A **DRM-protected FairPlay `.m4v`** and a DRM WMV (must fail-clearly).
- A **portrait/rotated** clip (rotation honoured); a **VFR screen recording**
  (to-GIF fps-normalise); a **silent** clip (extract-audio "no audio track" case);
  a long-ish clip to exercise the to-GIF guardrail/cap (§cross-category).

**Documents** (`tests/corpus/documents/`)
- **DOCX/DOC/ODT/RTF** real-world samples incl. **non-Latin (CJK) + RTL (Arabic/
  Hebrew)** body text, embedded images, a doc referencing a **non-bundled font**
  (substitution/reflow case), tracked-changes, a macro-enabled `.docm` (macro must
  drop, never execute).
- **PDF**: a text PDF (→TXT extraction), a **scanned/image-only** PDF (near-empty
  extraction, no OCR — honest), a **password-protected** PDF (fail-clearly), a
  malformed/truncated PDF (poppler/Ghostscript tolerance), a tagged/AcroForm PDF.
- **TXT** in UTF-8/UTF-16/Windows-1252 + an invalid-byte file (fail-clearly, no
  mojibake); **MD** (GFM: tables/task-lists/code-fences, a local image + a remote
  image-URL that must not be fetched, YAML front-matter); **HTML** (article-like →
  PDF faithful; a JS/complex-CSS page → must render static-only, no JS exec, no
  remote-asset fetch).

**Spreadsheets** (`tests/corpus/spreadsheets/`)
- **XLSX/XLS/ODS** with formulas, multiple sheets (multi-sheet→CSV one-sheet
  behaviour + note), charts/conditional-formatting (drop-on-CSV), hidden rows/cols,
  a **macro-enabled `.xlsm`** (drop macros), a **password-protected** workbook
  (fail-clearly), a **>65k-row** sheet (XLS legacy-limit lossy case), a sheet with
  CJK/RTL cell text.
- **CSV/TSV**: comma, **semicolon (European decimal-comma)**, tab, pipe samples;
  UTF-8-BOM, UTF-16, Windows-1252; embedded-newline-in-quoted-field (RFC-4180);
  ragged rows; a **leading `=`/`+`/`@` cell** (CSV-injection: must import as text,
  never evaluate); a leading-zero value (`0123`, mis-typing-defence case).

**Presentations** (`tests/corpus/presentations/`)
- **PPTX/PPT/ODP** with animations/transitions (flatten-to-PDF), **embedded video/
  audio** (poster-only on PDF), embedded vs non-embedded fonts (substitution),
  SmartArt/WordArt (cross-family approximation), CJK/RTL slide text, a
  macro-enabled `.pptm`, a password-protected deck (fail-clearly), a several-hundred-
  slide deck (size pre-flight).

Corpus files **must be redistributable**; where a real-world artifact can't be
licensed for the public repo, a **synthetic equivalent** that reproduces the same
structural property is used and noted in the manifest. `[OPEN-6.4a]` corpus storage
(in-repo vs Git LFS vs release-asset bundle) and target total size — co-owned with
§3.9 bandwidth concerns. **(recommendation: small synthetic + CC0 files in-repo;
larger real-world media in an LFS-backed `corpus-large` fetched only for the full
gate run, never required for the per-PR fast lane.)**

### 6.4.6 UI / end-to-end (the core-UX-flow gate)

A headed browser-driver run (**Tauri's WebDriver support / `tauri-driver`**, or
Playwright against the built app) exercises the full §5.2 flow per platform:
empty → drop (via the §0.4 native file-drop path, since HTML5 DnD yields no FS
paths) → collected/confirm → target+default → destination shown → progress →
summary → open-folder. This is the automated half of the DoD **core-UX-flow** gate;
the human half is §6.6. Frontend component/unit tests use **Vitest** (§0.8).

---

## 6.5 The reliability gate (DoD operationalised) `[DECIDED]`

> SSOT: *every sensible source→target pair across all categories works reliably on
> all three platforms*; "reliably" = passes fail-clearly + no-harm on the corpus;
> the corpus existing is a precondition.

### 6.5.1 The unit of "done" and how a pair is declared reliable

The unit is the **individual (source→target) pair** (a category is just its set of
pairs). A pair is **`reliable`** when, **on each of the three platforms** (or on
each platform where §3.4 says it is available), against **every corpus file of that
source format**:
1. it produces a **valid, correctly-detected output** of the target format
   (§6.4.3 structural check), **and**
2. it upholds **no-harm** (originals byte-identical; atomic write; no-clobber) and
   **fail-clearly** (the corpus's known-bad inputs for that source produce the
   *expected* failure kind, batch continues), **and**
3. its **lossy disclosure** matches §04 (fires iff flagged), **and**
4. content fidelity holds for the properties the corpus exercises (CJK/RTL,
   orientation, tags, channels, remux-when-possible).

A pair that meets all four on all three (available) platforms is marked `reliable`
in the **pair-status ledger** (§6.5.2). **No pair is "done" until the corpus run
backs it** — this is what makes the gate non-circular.

### 6.5.2 The pair-status ledger (machine-checkable)

CI maintains a generated **pair-status report** (`reliability-report.json` +
human table) keyed by `(source, target, platform)`, each cell ∈
`{reliable, failing, unavailable-per-§3.4, demoted}`. The **release gate** is:

> **Every enumerated pair is `reliable` on every platform where it is not
> `unavailable-per-§3.4` or explicitly `demoted`.** Any `failing` cell blocks the
> release. The report is published as a release asset (transparency).

This directly realises the SSOT *v1 DoD* conversions clause. Because v1 is **one
large all-or-nothing release with no deadline** (SSOT), the gate has no
time-pressure escape hatch — internal *sequencing* (fill/validate category by
category) is allowed (SSOT) and the ledger naturally tracks that progress.

### 6.5.3 Recording the two permissible exceptions (as release-note items)

Both SSOT exceptions are recorded **in the ledger and the release notes**, never as
silent omissions:
- **Exception 1 — patent per-platform gap (§3.4).** A pair `unavailable-per-§3.4`
  on a platform (e.g. an HEVC-encode-dependent HEIC target, or — the category's
  hardest dependency — H.264/AAC for the **MP4 default target**) is an **explicit,
  documented, honestly-surfaced** release-note line ("HEIC encoding is unavailable
  on Linux because no openly-redistributable HEVC encoder ships there"). The UI
  shows it unavailable (§5.2). **§3.4 owns the decision; this gate owns recording
  it.** *Critical dependency note:* MP4 is the default target of **every** video
  source (§04 video), so the gate **flags it as a hard precondition** that §3.4
  decide H.264/AAC `ship-bundled` on all three platforms — a platform without an MP4
  default target is a product-level problem the release notes must call out, not a
  per-format footnote.
- **Exception 2 — last-resort reliability demotion.** An in-scope, licence-clean
  pair that **genuinely cannot meet the bar despite reasonable effort** may be
  `demoted` to *Future Ideas (Parked)* as an **explicit, documented release-note
  item**, so one stubborn pair can't block the whole release forever. Demotion is a
  **last resort**, requires a recorded rationale in the ledger, and is **never** a
  convenience cut. (SSOT.)

### 6.5.4 Re-validation on engine bump

When §3.8 bumps a bundled engine (best-effort currency), the **full reliability gate
re-runs** before that engine version can ship (§6.3.4) — a patch must not silently
regress a pair. The ledger diff (pairs that changed status) is part of the bump's
review.

---

## 6.6 Usability-floor check `[DECIDED — gate; per-platform human walkthrough]`

> SSOT *v1 DoD*: *an ordinary non-technical person can complete each named
> conversion unaided on first try (drop → pick → convert → find output), validated
> by at least one informal non-developer walkthrough per platform.*

This is a **release gate** the automated §6.4.6 E2E flow **cannot** replace — it
specifically tests whether a *human who didn't build it* succeeds. Protocol:

- **Who:** at least **one non-developer** per platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) —
  three walkthroughs minimum. The SSOT usability walkthrough is also the natural
  place to validate the genuinely-debatable per-source defaults flagged in §04
  (XLSX→CSV vs →PDF; MP3-source→WAV vs FLAC; MOV-as-target demand).
- **What they must complete unaided (the named conversions = the DoD bar
  examples, one per category):** `mov→mp4`, `png→webp`, `heic→jpg`, `mp3` source →
  its default, `docx→pdf`, `xlsx→csv`, `pptx→pdf`, plus the two cross-category ops
  (extract-audio → MP3; a clip → GIF). Each via the **two-click common path**
  (drop → already-highlighted-or-pick target → convert) with **no instruction**.
- **What "counts" (pass criteria):** for each task the tester, with no help,
  (1) understands the empty screen and drops/browses a file; (2) sees the collected
  summary and confirms; (3) reaches a sensible result with the **pre-highlighted
  default** (no required choices); (4) sees **where it will save before converting**;
  (5) on completion uses **open-folder/open-file** and **finds the output**; (6)
  hits no stack trace, no cryptic message, no dead end. A task where the tester
  gets stuck or needs help **fails** the floor for that platform → fix → re-walk.
- **Accessibility floor (part of the same gate, SSOT *For anyone*):** at least one
  walkthrough completes the core path **keyboard-only** (per the §5.10 shortcut map)
  and verifies readable contrast/text-size; this checks the DoD **basic-a11y** gate
  with a human, complementing automated a11y assertions (§5.6).
- **Recording:** results captured in `docs/usability-floor.md` (per platform:
  tester profile, tasks, pass/fail, observed friction, the default-validation notes).
  This file is a **required v1 artifact**; the gate is "three platform walkthroughs
  recorded, all named conversions pass" before release.

`[OPEN-6.6a]` exact tester sourcing/count beyond the SSOT minimum-of-one-per-
platform — owner-level. **(recommendation: SSOT minimum of one non-dev per platform
for v1; more if cheaply available.)**

---

## 6.7 CI/CD `[DECIDED — two-lane pipeline]`

Two lanes, reflecting the platform CI standard (`reference_cicd_setup.md`:
reusable workflows + branch protection + auto-merge + deploy-gate) adapted from a
*server-deploy* model to a *desktop-release* model (there is **no server deploy** —
ConvertIA is a downloadable artifact; the "deploy" is a GitHub Release).

### 6.7.1 Lane A — PR / push validation (fast, every change)

Runs on the **self-hosted Linux runner** (cheap; `reference_self_hosted_ci_runner.md`)
for the OS-agnostic checks, fanning to the matrix only for compile-sanity:
1. **Lint/format:** `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings` (enforces the
   platform **no-`any`/no-unwrap-sloppiness** quality bar), ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`
   (no `any` — CLAUDE.md global rule), Prettier, `yamllint` (via `python3 -m`, per
   the platform runner PATH workaround in the recent commits).
2. **Rust↔TS type drift check (§0.4.5):** the codegen tool (ts-rs/specta/
   tauri-specta — decision owned by §0.4.5) regenerates the shared types and CI
   **fails if the committed types differ** (enforces the IPC contract + "no `any`").
3. **Unit + property + fault-injection tests (§6.4.1/§6.4.2)** — Rust + Vitest;
   fast, engine-light, run on every PR.
4. **Compile-sanity on the matrix:** `cargo check` / a debug `tauri build` on all
   three legs to catch platform-specific breakage early (no full corpus run here).
5. **`cargo audit` / `cargo deny`** (advisory + licence policy, §6.3.4).
Branch protection requires Lane A green before merge to `main` (matches the
platform's branch-protection + auto-merge model).

### 6.7.2 Lane B — Release pipeline (tag-triggered, the full gate)

Triggered by a release tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) on `main`. Stages, **in order**, each
blocking the next:
1. **Matrix build (native, §6.1.4):** stage engines per platform (§6.1.3), run
   `tauri build` → per-platform artifact (portable `.exe`/NSIS, universal `.dmg`,
   AppImage).
2. **Full reliability gate (§6.5):** integration + property + corpus + E2E on **all
   three** legs; emits `reliability-report.json`. **Any `failing` pair aborts the
   release.**
3. **SBOM + NOTICE assembly + attribution-completeness gate (§6.3):** generate
   CycloneDX (app + engines), assemble `NOTICE`/`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt`, run the
   §6.3.3 completeness check. **A missing/UNKNOWN attribution aborts the release**
   (release-blocking, same status as no-harm).
4. **Name/trademark clearance gate (§6.9):** assert the clearance record is present
   and current; if a rename was required, assert it propagated (the §6.9 check).
   **Blocks if not cleared.**
5. **Usability-floor evidence gate (§6.6):** assert `docs/usability-floor.md` records
   passing walkthroughs for all three platforms for this release line. **Blocks if
   absent.** (Human step — its *evidence* is what CI checks.)
6. **Integrity hashing (§6.2.3):** compute SHA-256 per artifact, build `SHA256SUMS`
   (+ optional signature, §6.2.3 `[OPEN]`).
7. **Publish to canonical GitHub Releases (§6.2.2):** upload artifacts + `SHA256SUMS`
   + `.sha256` files + SBOM (CycloneDX/SPDX) + `reliability-report.json` +
   `NOTICE`/`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` as a **single coordinated release** (one
   large all-or-nothing v1 — SSOT). The release body restates as-is/no-warranty +
   the verify-your-hash recipe (§6.2.4) and lists the two-exception release-note
   items (§6.5.3).

There is **no auto-update/phone-home publishing step** — the updater is explicitly
disabled/absent (§7.6); users learn of releases by visiting the page
(user-initiated, SSOT).

### 6.7.3 What CI does *not* do

No code-signing, no notarization, no store submission (SSOT *Out of Scope*) — only
the in-code-required artifacts (SBOM, checksums) are produced. No telemetry, no
network-touching test that would contradict the offline invariant (§2.11) — the
offline-observability test (6.10 / §2.11) asserts the *running app* makes **zero
network calls**, ideally enforced by running the E2E flow with network egress
blocked at the runner.

## 6.8 Repo governance & policy artifacts `[DECIDED — concrete deliverables]`

The SSOT *License & Openness* mandates a specific set of in-repo documents; each is
a **Phase-3 authoring task** and several are **referenced by the release gates**.
All are English (public OSS repo). Mapping each to its SSOT origin and content owner:

| File | Required content | SSOT origin / owner |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| **`LICENSE`** | MIT, header `Copyright (c) 2026 Ne-IA and ConvertIA contributors` (collective notice — inbound=outbound, **no assignment**). | SSOT *License & Openness*. Gate: present + name matches §6.9 clearance. |
| **`NOTICE`** + **`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt`** | Per-engine name+version, full licence text, written-offer-of-source for GPL-family. **Generated** from `engines.lock` + SBOM (§6.3.2), never hand-drifted. | SSOT *Engine-license policy*; **data owned by §3.7**, assembly here (§6.3), display §5.9. **Release-blocking** (§6.3.3). |
| **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** | Inbound=outbound under MIT; **no CLA**; **optional DCO sign-off** (`Signed-off-by`, *requested not required*); the **inbound-warranty clause** (contributors warrant submissions are their own work or compatibly-licensed for inbound MIT; incompatibly-licensed code is not accepted); how to run the test/lint lanes (§6.7.1); the no-`any`/no-TODO/no-`console.log`-in-prod/no-inline-CSS quality bar (CLAUDE.md). | SSOT *License & Openness* (contributions). |
| **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** | A standard CoC (Contributor Covenant-class) with the SECURITY/maintainer contact for enforcement. | SSOT *License & Openness* (a code of conduct accompanies the repo). |
| **`SECURITY.md`** | **Private vulnerability reporting** channel (GitHub private advisories + a contact); scope statement = ConvertIA opens **untrusted files through third-party decoders** → references the §0.11 threat-surface map and the §2.12 isolation posture; best-effort patch posture **with no SLA** (SSOT); how a reporter can include a (redacted, §7.5) repro from the local log. | SSOT *Security posture* / *License & Openness*; ties to §2.12, §7.5, §0.11. |
| **`PRIVACY.md`** | Plain-language restatement of **§2.11**: fully offline, **no network/telemetry/accounts/update-phone-home**; the only network is user-initiated (open project page, §7.7); the **cloud-sync caveat** (ConvertIA neither causes/prevents/detects your OneDrive/iCloud/Dropbox sync uploading files in a synced folder). | SSOT *Local/private/offline*; restates §2.11 (owner of the invariant). |
| **`TRADEMARK.md`** | The MIT grant covers **code, not the "ConvertIA" name or the Ne-IA logo**; forks/redistributions must use a **different name** and may **not** use the Ne-IA logo; guidelines for nominative use. | SSOT *Trademark*. |
| **`README.md`** (download + trust) | What it is, the **canonical-GitHub-Releases-only** download location (§6.2.2), the **verify-your-hash** recipe (§6.2.4), as-is/no-warranty + best-effort-security posture, supported-OS floor (§0.3.1), per-platform unsigned-build first-launch note. | SSOT *Distribution & download trust*. |
| **`.github/` policy** | Issue templates (default new format/feature requests to **Future Ideas (Parked)** per the SSOT inclusion test — SSOT *Out of Scope*); PR template referencing the DCO/quality bar; private-advisory config wired to `SECURITY.md`. | SSOT *Out of Scope* (inbound-request default) + governance. |

**DCO posture (explicit) `[DECIDED]`:** **no CLA**; a DCO **`Signed-off-by`** line
is **requested, not required** (SSOT: "a DCO sign-off may be requested, not
required"). CI **does not hard-block** an unsigned commit (that would make it
required) but **may surface a friendly reminder**; authorship is recorded in Git
history (the collective-notice / no-assignment model). The inbound-warranty clause
lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

`[OPEN-6.8a]` whether to additionally adopt a `GOVERNANCE.md`/maintainer model doc
for v1 — **(recommendation: defer; the seven files above satisfy the SSOT mandate;
add governance docs only if the contributor base grows.)**

---

## 6.9 Name/trademark clearance gate + rename propagation `[DECIDED — release-blocking; process out-of-scope, doing-the-check in-scope]`

> SSOT *Naming* + *v1 DoD*: trademark/name-collision risk for **both** "ConvertIA"
> **and** the public use of the "Ne-IA" brand has **not** been cleared; a clearance
> check (in the jurisdictions relevant to a globally-downloadable app) is a
> **precondition before first public release**, and the name **may change** if a
> conflict is found.

**Scope split (important):** *registering* a trademark is **out of scope** (SSOT
*Out of Scope* — no store/cert/vendor process). **Performing the clearance check and
propagating any required rename** is **in scope** as a release gate — this is the
distinction the README open-questions log records.

### 6.9.1 The clearance check (the gate input)

A documented clearance review for **both** marks ("ConvertIA" and the public "Ne-IA"
brand) across the jurisdictions relevant to a globally-downloadable app (at minimum
EU/EUIPO, US/USPTO, and a sanity check on common app-distribution regions), plus
common-law / existing-product / domain / package-name collision search (crates.io,
npm, GitHub org, app listings). The result is recorded in
`docs/name-clearance.md` with: marks checked, jurisdictions/registries searched,
date, findings, and a **verdict ∈ {clear, conflict→rename, conflict→abort}**. This
is an **owner/human task**, not automatable — but its **evidence is what the gate
checks**.

`[OPEN-6.9a]` **(owner-level, genuinely open):** the clearance verdict itself —
whether "ConvertIA"/"Ne-IA" are clear, and if not, the replacement name. This is a
real, unresolved precondition the SSOT explicitly leaves open; it **cannot** be
fake-resolved here. Fed to the README open-questions log. *No recommendation — this
is a legal/branding judgement for the owner.*

### 6.9.2 The release gate (CI-checkable)

Lane B stage 4 (§6.7.2) **asserts** `docs/name-clearance.md` exists, is dated for
the current release line, and its verdict is `clear` **or** `conflict→rename` with a
completed rename (next clause). A `conflict→abort` or a missing/stale record
**blocks the release**. (CI checks the *record*; the human does the *check*.)

### 6.9.3 Mechanical rename propagation (if a conflict surfaces)

If clearance returns `conflict→rename`, the rename is applied **before** release,
**never after** (SSOT). A single scripted, reviewable rename pass
(`scripts/rename-brand.*`) propagates the new name across **every** surface so no
stale "ConvertIA" leaks into a published build:
- repo/package identity: `Cargo.toml` (crate + `productName`), `package.json`,
  `tauri.conf.json` (`productName`, `identifier`, window title, bundle name),
  the GitHub repo + org references;
- **`LICENSE` / `NOTICE` / `TRADEMARK.md`** copyright/name lines;
- README, all §6.8 governance docs, the download page, the verify recipe;
- **branding**: the Ne-IA logo/app-icon assets and About-screen strings (§5.5/§5.9 —
  placeholders the owner controls), bundle icons, the `.desktop`/Info.plist names;
- the in-app product name strings (§5 UI-chrome) and the SBOM/`engines.lock`
  product field.
A post-rename CI **grep gate** asserts the **old name appears nowhere** in
shippable artifacts (a `rg` over the repo + the staged bundle for the old token,
excluding historical changelog entries). The rename is one atomic PR, reviewed,
then the release proceeds.

## 6.10 DoD-traceability checklist `[DECIDED — the "every behaviour has a home" table]`

Maps **every** SSOT *v1 Definition of Done* gate to its **owning spec section** and
the **§6 mechanism that verifies it**, so the README claim "every behaviour the SSOT
promises has a technical home" is **verifiable**. Each gate is marked
**in-scope-gate** (we implement+verify it) vs **out-of-scope-process** (the
*process* — e.g. registering a mark — is out; *doing/checking* it is in).

If a future SSOT clause is added, it must appear here with an owning section and a
§6 mechanism, or it has no technical home — that is the check this table enforces.

## Open-questions log contributions (this section)

Genuine owner-level `[OPEN]`s surfaced here (feed the README log):
- **[OPEN-6.9a]** Name/trademark **clearance verdict** for "ConvertIA" / "Ne-IA"
  (clear vs rename vs abort) — a real SSOT-mandated precondition; legal/branding
  judgement, **no recommendation**, release-blocking.
- **[OPEN-6.2a]** Sign `SHA256SUMS` with a project minisign/GPG key (strengthens the
  no-signing trust substitute without entering code-signing scope). *Recommend yes.*
- **[OPEN-6.1e]** macOS/Windows CI runners: GitHub-hosted vs self-hosted (Actions-
  minute spend vs the hobby/no-paid-upgrades budget). *Recommend GitHub-hosted for
  mac/win, self-hosted Linux for Lane A.*
- **[OPEN-6.1d]** CI engine-acquisition mechanism (vendored-LFS vs pinned checksum
  cache vs build-from-source) — co-owned with §3.9 size budget. *Recommend pinned
  checksum cache.*
- **[OPEN-6.4a]** Corpus storage/size (in-repo vs LFS `corpus-large`) — co-owned
  with §3.9. *Recommend small CC0/synthetic in-repo + LFS large for the full gate.*

Easy `[OPEN]`s resolved with a recommended default (not owner-level): artifact
