## 0.1 Goals & constraints recap (from SSOT)

The architecture is the smallest design that simultaneously honours every
load-bearing SSOT promise. These constraints are quoted here only to anchor the
decisions in the rest of the file; their *implementations* live in the owning
sections.

| SSOT promise (name) | Architectural consequence | Owner of the mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| *Portable, no installation* | Single self-contained artifact per OS; no installer, no admin rights, no system services; all engines ride inside the bundle | §0.2, §0.7, §06 |
| *Cross-platform, one product* | One codebase → three builds; identical UX/guarantees; per-platform variance confined to the WebView runtime (§0.3.1) and the §3.4 patent gaps | §0.2, §0.3.1, §06 |
| *Local, private & offline* | Zero network capability in the security boundary: no remote origins in CSP, no `http`/updater plugins on the allowlist; the only network is the user-initiated open-project-page shell-out | §0.10, §0.11, §2.11, §7.6 |
| *Never harm the original* / atomicity | A reusable **guarantees-fs** layer is a first-class module that ALL output flows through; engines never write the final file directly | §0.7, §2.1/§2.3/§2.6/§2.7/§2.14 |
| *Fail clearly* | A single error taxonomy crosses the IPC boundary as one typed error shape (§0.4); panics are caught at the worker boundary (§2.13) | §0.4, §2.8, §2.13 |
| *Security posture* (untrusted decoders) | Decoders run as **separate invoked subprocesses** behind the §2.12 isolation wrapper, never linked into the core; the WebView half is locked by §0.10 | §0.3, §0.9, §0.10, §0.11, §2.12 |
| *It just works by default* | The IPC surface is verb-oriented and stateful in Rust; the frontend is a thin view (§0.3) that never needs to enumerate a directory or hold engine knowledge | §0.3, §0.4 |

`[DECIDED]` These are inherited from Phase 1 and the SSOT; this file does not
re-open them.

## 0.2 Framework choice — Tauri `[DECIDED]`

**Decision (Phase 1, honoured here): Tauri v2.** Rust core + a React 19 / TypeScript
/ Tailwind / Vite WebView UI. Engines are **bundled sidecars/resources**, fully
offline (§3.3).

**Why Tauri over Electron / Wails:**

- **Size & portability.** Tauri uses the OS's **system WebView** (no bundled
  Chromium), so the *app shell* is a few MB of Rust + assets rather than ~150 MB
  of browser. This directly serves *Portable, no installation* and offsets the
  one accepted cost of *bundle-everything* — the heavy part of ConvertIA's
  download is the **engines** (FFmpeg, LibreOffice; §3.9), not the framework. An
  Electron baseline would add the browser weight *on top of* the engines.
- **Rust core.** The guarantees (atomic write, resolved-identity link safety,
  frozen set, cleanup) are filesystem- and concurrency-critical and benefit from
  Rust's ownership model and mature crates (see §0.8); subprocess orchestration of
  untrusted decoders wants a strong process/IO story. Electron's main process is
  Node (looser FS/concurrency story); Wails (Go) is viable but the platform's
  existing stack is React/TS, and Tauri lets us **reuse that stack verbatim** for
  the UI.
- **Security model.** Tauri v2 ships an explicit **capabilities/permissions**
  system + CSP (§0.10) — exactly the WebView-side lockdown the SSOT *Security
  posture* and *offline* promises need, declaratively, rather than hand-rolled.
- **Stack reuse.** React 19 / TS / Tailwind / Vite is the Ne-IA platform standard;
  the UI is "just a web app" with a typed IPC seam.

**What Tauri commits us to (trade-offs, addressed in the owning sections):**

1. **WebView runtime variance per OS** — the single biggest portability risk;
   owned by §0.3.1.
2. **Native file-drop, not HTML5 DnD** — the WebView cannot see real FS paths;
   intake is Rust-side (§0.4 boundary fact, §1.1, §5.4).
3. **The Rust↔TS boundary must be typed** to satisfy the platform "no `any`" rule
   — owned by §0.4.5.
4. **Sidecar invocation is gated by the capability allowlist** — the
   shell/`externalBin` scope (§0.10) is the seam through which §3.5 launches
   engines.
5. **The Tauri updater plugin must be deliberately absent** (no phone-home) —
   §7.6.

## 0.3 High-level architecture

**Two-tier, three-process-class model.**

**Tier responsibilities:**

- **WebView (UI tier)** — *view only.* Renders the screen states (§5.2), captures
  user intent, calls commands and subscribes to events/Channels (§5.8). It holds
  **no** filesystem access, **no** engine knowledge, and cannot enumerate a
  directory (the WebView has no real FS paths — §0.4 boundary fact). It is treated
  as **untrusted** by the core (the §0.10 capability allowlist is the contract).

- **Rust core (logic tier)** — *all logic.* IPC handlers (§0.4), the conversion
  orchestrator (queue/lifecycle — §1.9, owned by §01), content detection (§1.2),
  the **guarantees-fs** layer (§0.7; the reusable home of §2.1/§2.3/§2.6/§2.7/
  §2.14), the engine-registry seam (§3.2), and the subprocess pool (§0.9). It is
  the only tier that touches the filesystem and the only tier that spawns engines.

- **Engine subprocesses** — *the actual conversions and the untrusted-byte parsing.*
  Each is a **separate, independently-invoked binary** (aggregation, not linking;
  §3.6) so the MIT core stays clean and a decoder crash/hang is contained.
  Spawned and governed by the §0.9 pool, launched through the §3.5 argument
  construction, **routed through the §2.12 isolation wrapper** (the owner of the
  per-platform isolation mechanism). This section states *that* decoders are
  isolated subprocesses; **§2.12 owns *how* they are isolated** and is referenced,
  not restated, here.

**Process count.** One ConvertIA process (the Tauri host, which embeds the WebView
as the OS provides it) + N short-lived engine subprocesses, where N is bounded by
the §0.9 concurrency degree. No background services, no tray daemon (§7.3).

### 0.3.1 WebView runtime variance & supported-OS floor `[DECIDED — floor below]`

Tauri renders the UI in the **OS-provided WebView**, which differs per platform.
This is the principal portability risk and it interacts hard with *no-network*
(we may not download a runtime) and *no-installation*.

| OS | WebView runtime | Risk | Disposition |
|----|-----------------|------|-------------|
| Windows | **WebView2** (Chromium/Edge) | May be **absent or old** on older Windows; the standard Tauri remedy is the WebView2 **bootstrapper/installer**, but *that downloads at install time* — forbidden by *no-network / no-installation* | **Recommend: rely on the OS, require a present WebView2; do NOT download a runtime in v1.** Windows 11 ships WebView2 by default; Windows 10 has shipped it via Edge/Windows Update for years. **Honest failure mode `[DECIDED]`:** when WebView2 is **absent**, the WebView2 loader fails **before the Rust core runs** — the window flashes and closes and the core **cannot** present a §2.13/§7.2 in-app fault (tauri#12030; there is no built-in detection hook on the portable path). So the "fail clearly" substitute for the **canonical portable artifact (§6.1.2)** is a **§6.2.4 download-page WebView2 prerequisite note**, **not** a runtime dialog — the unconditional "never a silent blank window" promise does **not** hold for the portable launch. `bundle.windows.minimumWebview2Version` is **installer-only** (NSIS/WiX bootstrapper) — it is **inert for the portable artifact** and is scoped to the **secondary NSIS variant**, where the bootstrapper *can* enforce/install the floor. A *too-old* (present but below floor) WebView2 surfaces via the NSIS minimum-version check on that variant; on the portable path the practical floor is the §0.3.1 supported-OS floor (Win10 1809+ ships a recent-enough Evergreen runtime). (Stronger options recorded, not v1: make the WebView2-guaranteeing download the **NSIS per-user installer with bootstrapper**, and/or **bundle a fixed-version WebView2 runtime beside the exe** — a bundled runtime is not a runtime *download*, so no-network holds, at an artifact-size cost.) |
| macOS | **WKWebView** (system Safari/WebKit) | Tied to the OS version; no separate install | Pinned by `bundle.macOS.minimumSystemVersion`. |
| Linux | **WebKitGTK** (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1`) | **Distro drift** — version varies widely; the portable AppImage must carry/locate a compatible WebKitGTK | Bundled/located by the AppImage packaging (§6.1); a missing/incompatible WebKitGTK is a §7.2 startup fault with a plain message. |

**Supported-OS floor (v1) `[DECIDED]`** — adopting the recommended floor (the exact
build numbers stay tunable against the §6.4 drift matrix, but the floor is fixed):

- **Windows 10 (1809 / build 17763) and Windows 11**, x86-64, with WebView2
  present (Evergreen). `minimumWebview2Version` ≈ a recent-but-not-bleeding-edge
  Chromium (e.g. the `110.x` class) so our CSS/JS baseline is safe.
- **macOS 11 Big Sur and later** (covers the WKWebView feature set React 19 + our
  Tailwind build target need; `minimumSystemVersion: "11.0"`). Universal binary
  (Intel + Apple Silicon).
- **Linux: a glibc desktop with `libwebkit2gtk-4.1`** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS-class and
  newer, Fedora current); shipped as an x86-64 AppImage. ARM is out of v1.

Status: the **floor is `[DECIDED]`** (Windows 10 1809+/11; macOS 11+; Ubuntu
22.04-LTS-class `libwebkit2gtk-4.1`; x86-64). The architecture is indifferent to the
exact numbers and the *shape* (rely-on-OS WebView, fail clearly at startup if
absent/old, floor declared in config) was always `[DECIDED]`. The only residual is
**[DEFER: validate the precise build numbers against the §6.4 rendering-drift matrix
and §6.1 packaging]** — a calibration detail, not an open commitment.

**Rendering-drift implication (→ §6.4):** because three different browser engines
render the same UI, visual/behaviour drift (CSS, font rendering, drag-events) is a
test concern, not a runtime one. **Startup-time WebView faults (→ §7.2 / §2.13):**
an absent/old/broken WebView is an *app-level* fault, surfaced once, plainly.

---

## 0.4 Frontend ↔ backend boundary (IPC) — **single authoritative contract**

This section is **the** canonical enumeration of the IPC surface. §01 (pipeline)
and §5.8 (UI async model) **reference** these names and shapes; they never restate
or redefine them. The contract is the spine: changing a command/event/payload here
ripples to §01, §05, §0.4.5 codegen, and §06's drift check.

### 0.4.0 Mechanics (Tauri v2 primitives used)

- **Commands** = `#[tauri::command] async fn` handlers, registered in the
  `invoke_handler`, called from TS via `invoke('cmd_name', args)`. Long-running
  work is `async` so the WebView stays responsive (SSOT *visible progress, stays
  responsive*).
- **Shared state** = injected via `State<'_, T>` (e.g. the orchestrator handle,
  the run registry). Commands are thin; they delegate to the orchestrator.
- **One-way streaming Rust→TS** = **`tauri::ipc::Channel<T>`** — the v2 ordered,
  high-throughput channel. **Per-run progress uses a Channel** handed to the
  `start_conversion` command (ordered delivery, backpressure-friendly, scoped to
  the run — preferred over global events for hot per-item progress).
- **Broadcast / app-wide notifications Rust→TS** = `app.emit(event, payload)` /
  TS `listen(event, cb)` — used for **lifecycle-level** events not tied to a
  single run channel (e.g. `auth`-style app faults, startup readiness). The bulk
  of conversion telemetry goes through the Channel, not global events, to avoid
  cross-run leakage.
- **Error shape** = every command returns `Result<T, IpcError>` where `IpcError`
  is a `serde`-serialised enum (§0.4 error shape below). No command ever panics
  across the boundary (panics are caught at the worker boundary — §2.13 — and
  surfaced as an `IpcError`/failure outcome).
- **Cancellation** = a process-wide cancellation primitive keyed by `RunId`
  (§0.4 cancellation token). The mechanism that actually kills an in-flight engine
  is owned by **§1.7** (process-group kill; Windows has no SIGTERM); this section
  defines only the *token and the command* that trips it.

**Boundary fact — native file-drop `[DECIDED]`.** In a Tauri WebView, HTML5
drag-and-drop does **not** expose real filesystem paths. Intake therefore uses
**Tauri's native file-drop event** (the window `onDragDropEvent` / `DragDrop`
payload carries real `PathBuf`s) and the native **dialog** picker; **folder
recursion runs in Rust** (§1.1), because the WebView cannot enumerate a directory.
This constrains §1.1 (intake) and §5.4 (DnD UI). The frontend's DnD handler exists
only to drive hover/visual affordance; the *paths* arrive over the native event,
not the DOM drop.

### 0.4.1 Command enumeration (authoritative)

All payloads are the §0.6 domain types (or thin DTOs of them); field naming is
`camelCase` on the wire (Rust `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`). Pseudo-Rust
signatures; the TS side is generated (§0.4.5 codegen).

| # | Command | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| C1 | `ingest_paths` | `{ paths: Vec<PathBuf>, origin: IntakeOrigin, collectingId: CollectingId, drainPending?: bool, onScan?: Channel<ScanProgress> }` | `CollectedSet` | Builds the **frozen source set** (§2.4): recurse folders (Rust), ignore hidden/system files, de-dup by resolved identity (§2.3), run detection (§1.2), group by user-facing format (§1.3). Returns the collected-summary (detected format + count) **or** a `MixedDrop` / `Unsupported` / `Uncertain` outcome. `origin` distinguishes drop / picker / launch-arg (§7.8). The frontend generates `collectingId` and passes it in so C13 can cancel this in-flight walk **before** C1's long await resolves (see note). **`drainPending` (first-launch drain) `[DECIDED]`:** the frontend cannot hold the buffered launch paths (they live in the Rust-side `State<PendingIntake>`, §7.8.1), so the first-launch drain is a C1 call with **`paths: []` + `drainPending: true`**: the handler, seeing the flag, **consumes `PendingIntake`** (using its stored `origin`, typically `LaunchArg`) and freezes THAT set, returning its `CollectedSet`; if `PendingIntake` is empty it returns `CollectedSet::Empty`. A normal intake call omits `drainPending` (or `false`) and uses its `paths`. The two are mutually exclusive (a `drainPending: true` call ignores any `paths`). | **Optional `onScan` Channel `[DECIDED]`:** carries a **throttled live scan count** (`ScanProgress { scanned: u32 }`, ~2/s, §0.6) so the §5.2 *Collecting* state can show "Scanning… N files so far" during a long recursive walk; it is a **run-telemetry-style Channel**, NOT one of the three `app://` events (the §0.4.2 "no other IPC events" invariant covers `app.emit` events, not Channels handed to a command). |
| C2a | `pick_for_intake` | `{ kind: PickKind /* files \| folder */, collectingId: CollectingId, onScan?: Channel<ScanProgress> }` | `CollectedSet` | The **intake picker `[DECIDED]`.** Opens the native files/folder dialog **Rust-side via `DialogExt`** from this command's handler (so there is no `dialog:allow-open` WebView grant — §0.10). The picked paths are funnelled **straight into the C1 `ingest_paths` freeze Rust-side** and this command returns the **same `CollectedSet`** C1 returns — so **no raw FS path ever reaches the WebView** (the WebView only triggers the picker and receives the collected summary, never paths to re-submit). A **cancelled dialog is a clean no-op** that returns `CollectedSet::Empty` with no error and leaves the UI in Idle (§5.4). Takes the same `collectingId` + optional `onScan` as C1 so C13 can cancel the in-flight walk. |
| C2b | `pick_destination` | `{}` | `Option<PathBuf>` | The **destination-folder picker `[DECIDED]`.** Opens the native folder dialog **Rust-side via `DialogExt`** (still no `dialog:allow-open` grant) and **returns the chosen folder `PathBuf` to the WebView**, which carries it into **C5 `set_destination`** (and then C6). **This one path DOES transit the WebView** — unavoidable, because the destination is a WebView-held choice (§5.10 "Change destination") — and is **acceptable**: it is a *write* destination, not a source path, bounded by the §2.1 non-destructive creates (a chosen destination can never harm an original or read anything; §0.11 T2). `None` = the user cancelled (no-op; the held C4/C5 destination is unchanged). The "picked paths never transit the WebView" claim is scoped to the **intake** picker (C2a) only. |
| C3 | `get_targets` | `{ collectedSetId: CollectedSetId }` | `TargetOffer` | From the detected source type → the offered `Vec<Target>` + the **one pre-highlighted default** + per-target lossy flags + per-target availability (from §3.4) + the declared options model (§1.6). Pure function of detection; no engine spawned. |
| C4 | `plan_output` | `{ collectedSetId, target: TargetId, options: OptionValues, destination: DestinationChoice }` | `OutputPlanPreview` | Computes the `OutputPlan` (§1.8): resolved destination, beside-source vs chosen-root subtree re-creation, per-location divert preview, **re-run/equivalent-output detection (§2.5)** → may return a `RerunPrompt`. Also returns the §1.10 pre-flight verdict (size/space estimate, any up-front "too big" fail). Drives the "will save to …" line (SSOT *output lands somewhere obvious*) **before** convert. |
| C5 | `set_destination` | `{ collectedSetId, target: TargetId, options: OptionValues, destination: DestinationChoice }` | `DestinationResolved` | User changes the destination before convert; revalidates writability/divert **and re-evaluates the destination-dependent preflight** — the §2.14.4 free-space check on the new volume — returning a refreshed `PreflightVerdict` so the UI's held C4 verdict never goes stale (§1.8 destination-change re-validation). The §2.5 re-run verdict is **destination-INDEPENDENT in v1** (EquivKey has no destination component, §2.5.1) and is **carried through unchanged** from C4 — C5 does **not** recompute `rerun`. |
| C6 | `start_conversion` | `{ collectedSetId, target, options, destination, rerunDecision: RerunDecision, onProgress: Channel<ConversionEvent> }` | `RunId` | Creates a `RunId`, enqueues the batch (§1.9), spawns workers (§0.9), and **streams `ConversionEvent`s over the Channel** (E-series below). Returns immediately with the `RunId` (the run proceeds async; the Channel carries all telemetry). **C6's `destination` argument is AUTHORITATIVE `[DECIDED]`:** C4/C5 are plan/preview + revalidation only — there is **no separate server-side destination store**; the value the UI passes to C6 is what the run uses (the UI carries the last C5-resolved destination into C6). |
| C7 | `cancel_run` | `{ runId: RunId }` | `()` | Trips the §0.4 cancellation token for that run. The actual in-flight engine kill is §1.7's mechanism. Already-finished items are kept (SSOT *cancellable*); the in-progress item is discarded cleanly (§2.1/§2.6). |
| C8 | `get_run_summary` | `{ runId: RunId }` | `RunResult` | The end-of-batch summary (§1.12): per-item success/fail/skip + reasons + output→source map + residue warnings (§2.6). Also delivered as the terminal `ConversionEvent::RunFinished`; this command is the idempotent re-fetch (e.g. after a WebView reload). |
| C9 | `open_path` | `{ kind: OpenKind /* folder | file | revealInFolder */, path: PathBuf }` | `()` | The DoD "one-click open-folder/open-file" action. The Rust handler **validates `path` against the current `RunResult`'s recorded outputs (or their common root)** (§7.7.3 — the real, sufficient gate; works for arbitrary beside-source destinations) and then calls the opener plugin's `OpenerExt` (reveal/open) **internally**. **How** it shells out per OS is owned by §7.7; **which** path is allowed is the §7.7.3 RunResult check; there is **no `opener:*` WebView capability** (§0.10). |
| C10 | `open_project_page` | `{}` | `()` | The **only** permitted network action — user-initiated open of the canonical GitHub project/releases URL in the default browser (SSOT *Local/private/offline* "only network activity is user-initiated"). The Rust handler opens a **fixed URL constant** via `OpenerExt::open_url` internally; the WebView supplies no URL, so this single origin is the only reachable one (§7.6). No `opener:*` WebView grant (§0.10). |
| C11 | `get_app_info` | `{}` | `AppInfo` | Version, build id, and the **third-party-licenses / NOTICE** data for the About screen (data generated by §3.7; displayed by §5.9). No network. |
| C12 | `get_engine_health` | `{}` | `EngineHealth` | Startup self-check result: which bundled engines are present/runnable, which §3.4 patent-gated targets are available on this platform. Feeds §5.2 (disable/omit unavailable targets) and §7.2 (startup faults). Cached from the §7.2 startup probe; cheap to call. |
| C13 | `cancel_ingest` | `{ collectingId: CollectingId }` | `()` | Cancels an **in-flight** `ingest_paths` (C1) — the recursive walk/detection of a thousands-file folder (§1.10) can run long enough that the §5.2 *Collecting* state's cancel-collect control must have a backing command. Trips an **ingest-scoped `CancellationToken`** keyed by the pre-`RunId` `CollectingId` (§0.6) that the **frontend generated and passed to C1** (see note) — so C13 can name the in-flight walk even though C1's own response hasn't returned yet. The §1.1 walkdir/detection loop polls it and stops cooperatively, discarding the partial (un-frozen) set — **no cleanup obligation** (no temp is written during ingest). Keyboard: §5.10. |

**Notes binding to other owners:**

- `ingest_paths` is the single freeze point (§2.4) for **all** intake origins
  (drop, picker, launch args / second-instance hand-off — §7.1/§7.8).
- **Ingest cancellation handle `[DECIDED]`.** So C13 `cancel_ingest` can target an
  in-flight ingest (a drop's **C1** *or* the intake picker's **C2a**, which funnels
  through the same C1 freeze), the **frontend generates the `CollectingId` and passes it
  as a C1/C2a argument** (the single-funnel option). The Rust core registers the
  ingest-scoped `CancellationToken` under that id at handler entry (for **C2a**, *before*
  the native dialog opens — §1.1, so a C13 during the modal is honoured; for **C1**, at the
  start of the walk), trips it on C13, and **drops it on EVERY handler exit branch** — the
  normal walk-completes return, the C13-tripped return, **and** the C2a cancelled-dialog →
  `CollectedSet::Empty` return (the walk loop that normally drops it never runs there, so
  the handler drops it explicitly — no token leak). This mirrors the §0.4.4 `RunId` token
  lifecycle, one phase earlier.
  This keeps a single freeze point **and** keeps the §0.4.2 "no other IPC events"
  invariant true — there is **no** `collecting-started` event (an earlier draft
  proposed emitting one; rejected so the event enumeration stays closed).
- `get_targets`/`plan_output`/`start_conversion` together realise the SSOT flow
  *drop → pick target → (see destination) → convert*; the **pipeline that runs
  inside `start_conversion` is owned entirely by §01** — this contract only fixes
  the boundary.
- There is intentionally **no per-item-target command** — the **one-Target-per-
  Batch** invariant (§0.6) is enforced by the shape of `start_conversion` (a
  single `target` for the whole `collectedSetId`).
- **C4 vs C5 — byte-identical payloads, different contract `[DECIDED]`.** C4
  `plan_output` and C5 `set_destination` take the **same** request fields, but **only C4
  computes `rerun`** (the §2.5 equivalence check) and the §1.10 **`preflight` verdict**;
  **C5 never recomputes `rerun`** (it carries the C4 `rerun` through unchanged — the v1
  EquivKey is destination-independent, §2.5.1) and re-evaluates only the
  destination-volume `preflight`. Because the signatures alone cannot distinguish them,
  the orchestrator **enforces the asymmetry by lifecycle, NOT by a one-shot rule**:
  - **C4 is callable at any point in state 4 `[DECIDED]`.** It is called **eagerly on the
    `3→4` (target-chosen) transition with the pre-highlighted default already selected**,
    then **re-callable (debounced ~150 ms, §5.8) on any target or option change** so the
    "will save to …" line, divert preview, `rerun`, and `preflight.up_front_fail` verdict
    never go stale. There is **no "fires exactly once"** constraint — the multi-call
    behaviour §5.8 requires is canonical (an orchestrator that rejected the re-calls would
    break the Targets/options UI).
  - **C4 freezes after C5 on the same collected-set `[DECIDED]`.** Once the user has
    changed the destination (a C5 on a given `collectedSetId`), a **subsequent C4 on that
    same collected-set is a no-op/error** (the held C4 verdict + the C5-resolved
    destination are authoritative; further destination changes go through C5 only). This
    is the ONLY ordering rule — it bounds re-planning after a destination override, not the
    in-state-4 re-calls before one.

  So "C4 computes `rerun` + `preflight`, C5 never recomputes `rerun`" is an enforced
  orchestrator rule (computed values, not just prose); the destination-independent
  EquivKey is the §2.5 [DECIDED] this rests on.

### 0.4.2 Event / Channel enumeration (authoritative)

**Run telemetry — `Channel<ConversionEvent>`** (handed to `start_conversion`,
C6). A `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]` enum, ordered delivery:

| Variant | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RunStarted` | `{ runId, totalItems, willReencode: bool }` | Batch accepted; queue built. `willReencode` is a **conservative source-container → target-pair worst-case** flag (**re-encode *possible* ⇒ `true`**), **NOT a header/inner-codec inspection** — `RunStarted` is emitted right after C6, **before any `ffprobe`** (§1.7/§1.10 defer `ffprobe` to convert-time), so the inner codecs of MKV/MOV are **unknown** at emission and the flag is decided purely from the (source-container, target) pair (§2.9.2): `true` ⇒ at least one item *may* re-encode → video shows the worst-case lossy note ("may be re-encoded"). A pair whose only possible path is remux-verbatim is `false`; any pair that *could* re-encode is `true`. **Emission rule `[DECIDED]`:** for non-video / non-applicable batches the core emits **`willReencode: false`** (never omitted) so the field always carries a definite value. **The Rust struct field is non-optional `bool` (line below), so the GENERATED `bindings.ts` type is non-optional `willReencode: boolean`** — there is no third `undefined` state. (Hand-written docs/comments elsewhere sometimes show `willReencode?` purely as a decode-tolerance convenience — consumers still treat any absent/`undefined` as `false`, §5.8 — but the generated binding is non-optional.) The exact per-item disposition is resolved at convert-time (§3.5); the summary (§1.12) reflects the actual outcome. |
| `ItemStarted` | `{ runId, itemId, sourcePath, target }` | An item left `Pending` for `Running` (§1.9). |
| `ItemProgress` | `{ runId, itemId, fraction: Option<f32> /* 0.0..1.0; None only where truly indeterminate (LibreOffice, §1.11) */, stage: JobStage }` | **Real per-item progress** (SSOT *not an indeterminate spinner*). Denominator is engine-specific (e.g. video = source duration from `ffprobe`, §3.5/video.md). `stage` is the §0.6/§1.11 `JobStage` (`Spawning \| Decoding \| Encoding \| Writing`); for the `None`-fraction LibreOffice case the frontend synthesises a staged determinate-looking bar from `stage` transitions (§1.11/§5.3). |
| `ItemFinished` | `{ runId, itemId, outcome: ItemOutcome }` | Terminal per item: `Succeeded { outputPath } \| Failed { error: IpcError } \| Skipped { reason } \| Cancelled`. **Pre-flight-skip emission policy `[DECIDED]`:** pre-flight-skipped items (§1.1/§1.3 — never entered the queue, §1.9) are **NOT** emitted as live `ItemFinished{Skipped}` Channel events; they appear **only** in the terminal `RunFinished → RunResult.items` projection (§1.12). The `ItemOutcome::Skipped` variant is **reserved for that terminal-projection path** (it is not dead wire code — it carries the projected pre-flight skips and any mid-run cooperative skip), so the orchestrator emits **no live `ItemStarted`/`ItemFinished{Skipped}`** for a freeze-time skip; the ProgressList shows skipped rows only once the run reaches `Summary`. (Chosen over a post-`RunStarted` batch flush: pre-flight skips have no queue presence and no per-item work, so surfacing them once, terminally, is simpler and matches §1.9's "never enter the queue".) |
| `BatchProgress` | `{ runId, done, total }` | Aggregate queue progress for the batch bar (§1.11). |
| `RunFinished` | `RunResult` | Terminal for the run; mirrors C8. Carries the full summary incl. residue warnings (§2.6). |

**The complete enum + payload structs (the concrete type `collect_events![]` (§0.4.5)
needs).** All derive `Clone, Serialize, specta::Type` (no `any`; in `collect_types!`):

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, specta::Type)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase", tag = "type", content = "data")]
pub enum ConversionEvent {
    RunStarted(RunStarted),
    ItemStarted(ItemStarted),
    ItemProgress(ItemProgress),
    ItemFinished(ItemFinished),
    BatchProgress(BatchProgress),
    RunFinished(RunResult),          // §0.6 RunResult (mirrors C8)
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize, specta::Type)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct RunStarted   { pub run_id: RunId, pub total_items: u32, pub will_reencode: bool }
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, specta::Type)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct ItemStarted  { pub run_id: RunId, pub item_id: ItemId, pub source_path: PathBuf, pub target: TargetId }
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, specta::Type)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct ItemProgress { pub run_id: RunId, pub item_id: ItemId, pub fraction: Option<f32>, pub stage: JobStage }
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, specta::Type)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct ItemFinished { pub run_id: RunId, pub item_id: ItemId, pub outcome: ItemOutcome }
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, specta::Type)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct BatchProgress{ pub run_id: RunId, pub done: u32, pub total: u32 }
```
(`will_reencode` is a plain `bool` on the wire — the core always emits a definite value,
§2.9.2 emission rule; `JobStage`/`ItemOutcome`/`RunResult` are the §0.6 types.)

> **Why a Channel, not events, for run telemetry:** ordering (progress monotonic
> per item), throughput (a 5000-file batch emits a lot), and **scoping** (the
> Channel dies with the run — no cross-run leakage, no global listener cleanup
> bug). This is the Tauri v2 recommended pattern for streamed Rust→frontend data.

**Intake scan telemetry — `Channel<ScanProgress>`** (optional, handed to `ingest_paths`,
C1). Same Channel pattern as run telemetry (NOT an `app://` event):

| Variant / payload | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ScanProgress { scanned: u32 }` | A **throttled** live count (≈2/s, coalesced) of files seen so far during the §1.1 recursive walk + §1.2 detection, so the §5.2 *Collecting* state can show "Scanning… N files so far". Best-effort, monotonic, dies with the C1 call. |

**App-wide events — `app.emit` / TS `listen`** (not run-scoped):

| Event | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `app://fault` | `AppFault` | An **app-level** fault (§2.13): WebView core disconnect, a startup engine-missing escalation, damaged bundle. The UI shows a plain, no-stack-trace message (§5.8 backend-disconnect handling). |
| `app://intake` | `{ paths, origin }` | The OS handed the running (single) instance new paths via a **second-instance launch / Open-with** (§7.1/§7.8), **and the app was IDLE**. **IDLE-path only `[DECIDED]`:** the refuse-busy check is **core-side** in `forward_launch_intake` (§7.8.1) **before** the freeze — while a run is in flight the core **refuses-busy and DROPS the paths core-side**, so it does **NOT** emit `app://intake` with ingestable paths mid-run (the only mid-run UI surface is `BusyNotice`, §5.3, driven by window re-focus, not this event). On the idle path the core emits `app://intake` and the frontend reacts by calling C1 `ingest_paths`. `origin` is only ever `LaunchArg` / `SecondInstance` here (drop & picker go via C1/C2a directly, never through this event — so a frontend `app://intake` handler needs no `Drop`/`Picker` branch). Cross-ref §1.1. |
| `app://close-requested` | `()` | The OS window-close was intercepted **while a run is in flight** (§7.3.2): the core called `prevent_close` and asks the frontend to show the quit-while-converting confirm (§5.2/§7.3.3). The emit/intercept mechanism is owned by §7.3; the event name is fixed here. |

Apart from these three (`app://fault`, `app://intake`, `app://close-requested`),
there are **no other IPC events**. No telemetry, no heartbeat, no network-driven
event — consistent with *offline / no phone-home* (§2.11, §7.6).

### 0.4.3 Error shape (authoritative) — `IpcError`

Every command's `Err` and every `ItemOutcome::Failed.error` is one shape:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, specta::Type)]   // generated into bindings.ts; in collect_types![] (§2.8)
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub struct IpcError {
    /// Stable machine code from the §2.8 taxonomy — drives UI branching + i18n.
    pub kind: ErrorKind,
    /// Pre-localised plain-language English message (the §2.8 catalog string).
    /// NEVER a stack trace, never raw engine stderr (SSOT *no stack traces*).
    pub message: String,
    /// Optional path the error concerns (for the summary's output→source map).
    pub path: Option<PathBuf>,
    /// Optional residue location when cleanup could not complete (§2.6) — so the
    /// item is never reported as a clean success.
    pub residue: Option<PathBuf>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, specta::Type)]   // generated into bindings.ts; in collect_types![] (§2.8)
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
pub enum ErrorKind {
    // Wire mirror of §2.8 `ConversionErrorKind` — names are byte-identical to the
    // owner (§06 drift check enforces this). Item-level (§2.8):
    Corrupt, Empty, Unrecognized, UnsupportedType, UnsupportedPair,
    Unreadable, Gone, PasswordProtected, NoAudioTrack, TooBig, OutOfDisk,
    WriteFailed, PathTooLong, TooManyCollisions, EngineCrash, EngineHang, EngineError,
    PlatformUnavailable, QuarantinedByOs, CleanupResidue, InternalError,
    // run/app-level (§2.13):
    MixedDrop, EngineMissing, WebviewFault, BundleDamaged,
}
```

> **Note — `Cancelled` is not an `ErrorKind`.** A cancelled item is the
> `ItemOutcome::Cancelled` variant (§0.4.2), not a failure; it never carries an
> `IpcError`. The wire enum mirrors **only** the §2.8 taxonomy.

- **Both `IpcError` and `ErrorKind` derive `specta::Type` and are registered in
  `collect_types![]`** (consistent with §2.8 §2.8.2): tauri-specta generates
  `bindings.ts` only from `specta::Type` types, so without the derive `ItemOutcome::
  Failed.error` and every command `Err` would generate as `any` — a no-`any`-rule
  violation. The §06 bindings-drift check (§0.4.5) covers both.
- The **authoritative enumeration of failure kinds and their exact English
  strings is owned by §2.8** (the message catalog). `ErrorKind` here is the wire
  mirror; §06 includes a drift check that the §2.8 catalog and this enum stay in
  lock-step. **The concrete anti-drift mechanism is owned by §2.8.2 `[DECIDED]`:**
  preferably **`ErrorKind` is a `type` alias for the §2.8 `ConversionErrorKind`** (one
  enum, nothing to drift); if a distinct wire type is needed, a `static_assertions`
  variant-count check + a variant-name round-trip `#[test]` make a missing mirror a
  **compile/test failure**, with the §06 codegen-drift diff as the third backstop. `message`
  is filled from the §2.8 catalog **in Rust** (strings live
  with their owner; the UI does not assemble outcome strings — §5.7).
- `kind` is the stable contract the UI branches on (e.g. `PasswordProtected` →
  "password-protected" copy; `EngineMissing` → app-fault screen).

### 0.4.4 Cancellation token (authoritative)

- A `RunId` indexes a `CancellationToken` (recommend `tokio_util::sync::
  CancellationToken`) held in the run registry (`State`). `cancel_run` (C7)
  calls `.cancel()`.
- Workers poll/await the token at safe points and, crucially, the **§1.7
  invocation layer** wires the token to the engine subprocess so a cancel triggers
  the process-group kill (§1.7 owns the kill mechanism and the ordering that keeps
  §2.6 cleanup and §2.1 no-partial intact). This section owns only the token's
  *identity and lifecycle* (created in C6, tripped by C7, dropped on `RunFinished`).
- Cancellation is **cooperative at the orchestrator level, forceful at the engine
  level** (kill the child), reconciled by §1.7.

**Run-registry retention (so C8 can re-serve after a WebView reload).** The run
registry retains the terminal **`RunResult` in memory** (process-local, no on-disk
persistence — consistent with §7.4) **until a new run starts or the app exits**, so
**C8 `get_run_summary` can idempotently re-serve** the summary after a WebView
reload (the exact case C8 names). "The cancellation token is dropped on
`RunFinished`" (above) drops only the *token*, **not** the `RunResult` — the result
outlives the token for re-fetch.

> **Reload-during-run is NOT a supported recovery path on macOS in v1 `[DECIDED]`.**
> There is a **known still-open macOS Tauri crash when the WebView reloads while an async
> command / `invoke` is in flight** (tauri-apps/tauri #9933 / #12338 — distinct from the
> #12030 WebView2-absent case the spec already cites). So C8's "idempotent re-serve" and
> the long-lived `Channel<ConversionEvent>` cover a **FRESH listener attaching after the
> run has already terminated** (re-fetch the retained `RunResult`, re-subscribe for a new
> run) — **not** a reload *mid-stream* while C6's run is still emitting. v1 does **not**
> claim reload-during-run resilience on macOS; the §6.4.6/§6.6 macOS verification covers
> the post-terminal re-serve, and §5.8 surfaces a mid-run IPC drop as `AppFault` (the run
> path), never as a silently-recovered reload. (Windows/Linux are not affected by this
> specific bug, but v1 scopes the guarantee to post-terminal re-serve uniformly.)

**Collected-set registry (so C3/C4/C5/C6 can resolve a `CollectedSetId`) `[DECIDED]`.**
C3 `get_targets`, C4 `plan_output`, C5 `set_destination` and C6 `start_conversion`
each take only a `collectedSetId` and must resolve it to the **frozen `CollectedSet`**
(detected format, frozen `items`, dropped `roots`, `skipped`) — C3 reads the stored
source format, C4/C5 plan against the stored roots, C6 rebuilds the `Batch` from the
stored frozen items (§2.7 needs the roots for subtree re-creation). The core therefore
holds a **collected-set registry**: a `State<'_, T>` map **`CollectedSetId →
FrozenCollectedSet`** (the `CollectedSet::Single` payload + its `roots`), mirroring the
`RunId`-token / `CollectingId`-token lifecycle pattern. **Lifecycle:** an entry is
**created when C1/C2a returns** a `CollectedSet::Single` (the freeze, §2.4), **retained
through C3/C4/C5/C6**, and **evicted** when its run starts (C6 hands the frozen items to
the `Batch`), or when a new C1/C2a supersedes it, or at app exit. C3 is thus a **pure
function of the stored detection result** and C6 builds the `Batch` from the **stored
frozen items** — no second walk, no re-detection. (`Mixed`/`Unsupported`/`Uncertain`/
`Empty` outcomes are terminal pre-flight states and are **not** registered — only a
`Single` yields a resolvable `CollectedSetId`, §0.6 invariant 3.)

### 0.4.5 Rust↔TS type-sharing strategy `[DECIDED — tauri-specta]`

The platform rule is **no `any`**; the Rust↔TS boundary must be typed with a
single source of truth. Options surveyed:

| Approach | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **Manual mirroring** | Rejected — guaranteed drift; violates the "no `any` by accident" intent. |
| **ts-rs** | Generates `.ts` from Rust types via derive, but treats types **individually** (a type and its dependency graph aren't exported together cleanly) and, critically, **does not model Tauri *commands or events*** — we'd still hand-write the `invoke`/Channel wrappers and could drift on argument names. |
| **specta** (alone) | The introspection layer ts-rs lacks (full type graph), but not Tauri-aware on its own. |
| **tauri-specta** (specta + Tauri integration) | **Recommended.** Purpose-built for Tauri v2: annotate commands with `#[specta::specta]`, collect via `collect_commands![]` / `collect_events![]`, and it emits a single `bindings.ts` exposing **typed `commands.*` wrappers, typed event/Channel helpers, and all referenced types** — exactly the C1–C13 + E-series surface above, with no `any` and no hand-written invoke glue. |
| **JSON-schema** | Heavier toolchain, no first-class Tauri command typing; rejected. |

**Decision `[DECIDED]`:** adopt **tauri-specta** (with specta). The spec already
leans on it everywhere (the §5.8 generated `commands.*`/`ConversionEvent` examples
assume it), so this is closed rather than left dangling. Generated output lands at a
single tracked path — **`src/lib/ipc/bindings.ts`** (the frontend's only door to the
backend; §5.1/§5.8 import from here and never call raw `invoke`). Generation runs as
part of the debug build / a dedicated `cargo` step; **§06 owns a CI drift check**
that fails if `bindings.ts` is stale vs the Rust source (regenerate +
`git diff --exit-code`).

**Held-in-reserve fallback (not a v1 open question):** if tauri-specta v2 proves
unstable against our pinned Tauri (§0.8), the documented fallback is **specta for the
types + a thin hand-written, drift-checked command map**. This is a contingency, not
an undecided choice — the default is tauri-specta and the §06 drift check guards it
either way. The *decision to codegen, not mirror* and the *tool* (tauri-specta) are
both `[DECIDED]`.

## 0.6 Core domain model

The shared vocabulary. These are **Rust** types (the source of truth); the TS
mirror is generated (§0.4.5). `RunId`/`InstanceId` are **defined by §7.1** and
referenced here (this section does not own their identity policy). Fields are
illustrative-but-concrete; invariants are normative.

```rust
// ─── Identity (defined by §7.1; referenced here) ────────────────────────────

pub struct RunId(Uuid);        // one per start_conversion (§0.4 C6 / §7.1)
pub struct CollectedSetId(Uuid);
pub struct ItemId(u32);        // stable within a run
pub type JobId = ItemId;       // §1.7/§1.8 say "JobId"; it IS the ItemId of the job's item

   every `ConversionJob` in the batch. There is no per-item target — enforced by
   the absence of any per-item-target IPC command (§0.4) and by `start_conversion`
   taking one `target`. (SSOT *How It Feels* 4: "one chosen target applies to the
   whole same-source batch".)
2. **One effective `OptionValues` per `Batch`.** Same rationale; also what §2.5
   keys "same effective settings" on.
3. **A `Batch` exists only from a `CollectedSet::Single`.** `Mixed`/`Unsupported`/
   `Uncertain`/`Empty` never produce a batch — they are pre-flight terminal states
   (§1.3 refusal / §1.2 decline). No subset conversion.
4. **The `items` set is frozen and resolved-identity-deduplicated** at ingest
   (§2.4/§2.3); nothing is added after the freeze, including outputs landing in a
   source folder.
5. **`OutputPlan.publish_temp_dir` (where the kind-1 `*.part` lives — EQUALS `final_dir`
   in v1, the `*.part` being a sibling dotfile, not a subdir, §2.14.1) and `final_dir` are
   on the same filesystem** (§2.14) so the §2.1 publish is a true intra-volume atomic
   rename; the
   exact numbered final name is resolved at write time, never stored. When the only
   obtainable scratch spans volumes, `fs_guard::atomic_publish` detects this
   **reactively on EXDEV / cross-device failure** (not via a pre-planned flag) and
   runs the §2.14.3 copy→fsync→exclusive-rename-within-destination fallback.
6. **`ItemId` is stable within a `RunId`** so progress/finished events and the
   summary all address the same item. **`ItemId` is assigned at the §1.1 freeze**
   (collected-set) as the stable index of each item in **the de-duplicated frozen `Vec`
   of ALL dropped items — eligible AND skipped alike** (§2.4), assigned **once** over
   that single id space. `CollectedSet::Single.items` (eligible `DroppedItem`s) and
   `.skipped` (ineligible `SkippedItem`s) are **id-disjoint filtered VIEWS over that one
   id space** — they are **never re-indexed from 0**, so a `SkippedItem.item` can never
   collide with an eligible item's id, and §1.12 can project the skipped items into
   `RunResult.items` without an id clash. The id is identical through `Batch`/`Run` and
   every per-item event (`SkippedItem` pre-`RunId`, `ItemProgress`/`ItemFinished` in-run).

The **detection algorithm** (§1.2), **lifecycle transitions** (§1.9), **engine
selection** (§3.2), **per-format options/defaults** (04-formats), **output-naming
mechanics** (§2.2) and **identity policy** (§7.1) are owned by those sections;
this model only fixes the *shapes and invariants* the whole system shares.

## 0.7 Project layout & logical module decomposition

### Logical modules (the architecture — owned here)

Dependencies point **downward only**; nothing below depends on anything above it
(so the directory tree does not silently *become* the architecture). The
**guarantees-fs** layer and the **engine-registry seam** are the two reuse hubs.

**Module responsibilities & who owns the behaviour:**

- **`ipc`** — the §0.4 command/event handlers; the *only* module the WebView
  reaches. Thin: validate, delegate to `orchestrator`, map `Result` → `IpcError`.
- **`orchestrator`** — the §01 pipeline conductor: builds the queue, drives
  `JobState`, holds the run registry + cancellation tokens (§0.4.4), and fans
  progress out to the Channel. Owns nothing the guarantees/engines own; it
  *sequences* them.
- **`detection`** — §1.2 content sniffing. First code to touch untrusted bytes;
  §1.2 owns whether header sniffing sits inside/outside the §2.12 boundary.
- **`engine-registry seam`** — the §3.2 `Engine` trait + registry + selection, the
  §1.7 generic invocation lifecycle, and §3.5 per-engine arg construction; every
  spawn routes through the §2.12 isolation wrapper and the §0.9 pool. This is the
  reusable engine home — adding a format pair is (mostly) a registry entry.
- **`guarantees-fs`** — the **reusable home of the no-harm machinery**:
  no-clobber/atomic write (§2.1), resolved-identity & link safety (§2.3), frozen
  set (§2.4), cleanup/temp ownership (§2.6), destination/divert (§2.7), cross-
  volume strategy (§2.14). Every output flows through here; **engines never write
  the final file** — they write to a temp the guarantees-fs layer owns, which then
  performs the atomic publish.
- **`domain`** — the §0.6 types + §2.8 error taxonomy; depended on by everyone,
  depends on nothing.
- **`subprocess pool`** — §0.9; the concurrency-degree owner and the per-engine
  parallelism rules (LibreOffice serialised).

**Engine-registry-as-crate `[OPEN → recommend: module first, extract later]`:**
the §3.2 seam *could* be its own crate (`convertia-engines`) to enforce the
dependency direction at the compiler level. Recommendation: **start as a module**
(`src-tauri/src/engines/`) and extract to a workspace crate only if a second
consumer (e.g. a headless test harness) appears. Flagged for §3.2/§0.7 sign-off.

> **Note — image codecs run in a separate image-worker process `[DECIDED]`.** Unlike
> FFmpeg/LibreOffice/pandoc/poppler (clearly separate binaries), the image core
> (libvips + libheif/libde265 + the librsvg SVG load module + cgif, per images.md)
> *could* be linked as a Rust crate **or** run out-of-process. The **isolation
> requirement (§2.12) for untrusted image bytes** (the T1 headline threat — a
> libvips/libheif/librsvg memory-corruption exploit must not run inside the ConvertIA core address
> space) settles it: **v1 runs image decode/encode in a separate short-lived
> image-worker process**, so a hostile-image exploit is contained by the same OS
> process boundary as every other engine and §2.12.4's "all decoders are
> subprocesses" stays true. (§3.6 licensing is unaffected — libvips is LGPL either
> way; this is a security/robustness call, now resolved.) The image-worker still
> *links* libvips/LGPL libs internally, which is aggregation, not a link into the MIT
> core (§3.6.1). The `EngineKind` field on the §0.6 `EngineDescriptor` records the
> image core as `Subprocess` (the worker process); only the native CSV/TSV engine
> (§3.5.6) is `InProcessNative`.

## 0.8 Tech stack & pinned versions

`[DECIDED]` framework & language; `[OPEN]` exact patch pins (locked at first build,
recorded in lockfiles + the SBOM, §6.3). Versioning policy: **pin everything**
(Cargo.lock + pnpm-lock committed); bumps are deliberate and re-validated against
the corpus (§6.4) — engine bumps are best-effort posture (§3.8), not a gate.

| Layer | Choice | Pin policy |
|---|---|---|
| Rust toolchain | stable (recommend a recent stable, e.g. `1.8x` class as of build) via `rust-toolchain.toml` | pinned channel |
| Tauri | **v2** (`tauri` 2.x, `tauri-build`, `@tauri-apps/api` 2.x) | exact, lockfile |
| Async runtime | **tokio** (multi-thread) — Tauri's async commands run on it; subprocess IO + Channel feed off it | exact |
| IPC type-gen | **tauri-specta** + **specta** (§0.4.5, `[DECIDED]`) | exact |
| Cancellation | **tokio-util** (`CancellationToken`) | exact |
| Error plumbing | **thiserror** (core error enums) → mapped to `IpcError` (§0.4.3); `serde` for wire | exact |
| Detection | content-sniffing crate(s) — `infer` and/or hand-rolled magic tables; §1.2 owns the strategy | exact |
| FS guarantees | `tempfile` (owned scratch), `same-file`/`dunce` (resolved-identity, Windows path canonicalisation), `fs2`/platform calls (free-space), atomic rename via std + §2.14 cross-volume fallback | exact |
| Frontend | **React 19**, **TypeScript** (strict, no `any`), **Vite** (per platform CLAUDE.md, current major), **Tailwind CSS** | exact, lockfile |
| Frontend state | lightweight store (recommend **Zustand**) + the generated `bindings.ts`; §5.1 owns the final choice | §5.1 |
| Package mgr | **pnpm** (`pnpm@10.13.1` class per platform standard) | pinned |
| Test | **Vitest** (frontend), **cargo test** + corpus harness (§6.4), property tests for guarantees | exact |
| Engines (bundled) | FFmpeg (GPL-2.0+ build — enables x264, §3.6.1), LibreOffice, poppler, pandoc, ImageMagick (required, permissive), libvips+libheif/libde265+x265-plugin/libaom/dav1d+librsvg+cgif — **all §3.1/§3.3 owned**; versions pinned + in the SBOM (§6.3). Ghostscript **[DECIDED: dropped v1]** (§3.1). | §3.8 best-effort |

**Additional crates / plugins other sections depend on (pinned, in lockfile + SBOM):**

| Crate / plugin | Used by | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **process-wrap** | §1.7 | cross-platform process-group / Job-Object spawn+group-kill (engine tree teardown) |
| **walkdir** | §1.1 | ergonomic recursive folder enumeration (Rust-side intake) |
| **chardetng** | §1.2 | text-encoding detection for the magic-less formats |
| **flate2** (`rust_backend`/miniz_oxide feature ONLY — pure safe Rust, NO zlib/zlib-ng C backend) | §1.2 | bounded in-core `.svgz` (1F-8B) inflate for content detection (≤64 KiB + ≤100× ratio cap); pure-Rust so the §2.12.4 "no third-party C/C++ decoder in-core" absolute holds |
| **tauri-plugin-single-instance** | §7.1 | single-instance policy + launch-arg hand-off |
| **tauri-plugin-store** | §7.4 | the single `settings.json` prefs blob (theme + lastDestinationMode + verboseLog) |
| **tauri-plugin-log** | §7.5 | local-only rotating diagnostic log + JS bridge |
| **tauri-plugin-opener** | §7.7 | open-folder / open-file / open-url shell-out (the only OS shell-out) — called **Rust-side via `OpenerExt`** from the C9/C10 handlers (no WebView `opener:*` grant, §0.10/§7.7.1) |

Concrete crate **versions are deliberately not hard-coded in this prose** (they go
stale); the lockfiles + SBOM are the source of truth (§6.3). This table fixes the
*choices*, not the digits.

---

## 0.9 Concurrency, threading & engine-subprocess pool — **owner of the concurrency degree**

**Async runtime.** tokio multi-threaded. Tauri commands are `async` and return
quickly (C6 returns a `RunId` immediately; the run proceeds in the background and
streams over the Channel) so the WebView never blocks (SSOT *stays responsive*).

**The pool & the single concurrency-degree number.** A bounded **engine-subprocess
pool** governs how many engine processes run at once. **This number lives here;
§1.10 references it for budgets, §1.11 for batch progress.**

`[DECIDED] default concurrency policy:`

- **Global degree = `clamp(physical_cores − 1, 1, 4)`**, default-capped low because
  the heaviest engines are CPU-bound (video re-encode) and we must keep the app
  responsive and the machine usable. A sensible everyday default is **2–4**; the
  cap of 4 prevents a 16-core machine from spawning 16 FFmpeg re-encodes and
  thrashing.
- **Per-engine parallelism overrides the global degree where correctness or
  resource pressure demands:**

| Engine | Parallelism | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **LibreOffice** (`soffice --headless`) | **serialised — exactly 1 at a time** `[DECIDED]` | LibreOffice headless is **NOT safely parallel under one user profile**: concurrent `soffice` instances sharing a profile **lock/corrupt** it — a *correctness* issue, not just contention. The pool runs a dedicated **single-slot LibreOffice lane**; all office/PDF-export jobs (documents/spreadsheets/presentations) serialise through it. Mitigation detail (per-run isolated `-env:UserInstallation` profiles) is co-owned with §3.5; even with isolated profiles the safe v1 stance is **one office conversion at a time**. |
| **FFmpeg** (video re-encode) | **low — 1–2** | CPU-bound; already the slowest op (video.md). Counts against the global degree. |
| **FFmpeg** (audio / extract-audio / remux) | up to global degree | light/IO-bound; may run more in parallel. |
| **Image core** (vips/heif/avif/svg) | up to global degree | per-item, bounded-memory (vips streaming); fast. Runs as a **separate image-worker process** `[DECIDED]` (§0.7/§2.12), one short-lived worker per item, so a hostile-image decoder exploit is process-isolated like every other engine. |
| **poppler / pandoc** | up to global degree | light, short-lived. |
| **native CSV/TSV** (in-Rust, no subprocess) | up to global degree (worker threads) | trivial cost. |

- **Effective parallelism = `min(global_degree, per_engine_cap)`.** The per-engine
  caps above **override** the global degree downward, never upward: e.g. video
  re-encode runs at `min(global_degree, 2)`, LibreOffice at exactly 1 regardless of
  the global degree. A batch mixing engines respects each engine's own cap within
  the shared global bound.
- **`EngineDescriptor.serialised_only` enforcement mechanism `[DECIDED]`.** For an
  engine whose descriptor has `serialised_only = true` (LibreOffice), the pool holds a
  **dedicated single-permit semaphore** (one per serialised engine). A job for that
  engine must **acquire BOTH** the global degree semaphore **and** that engine's
  single-permit semaphore **before spawn**, and **releases both on subprocess exit**
  (success/fail/kill). This is the concrete code that *reads* `serialised_only`: the
  pool, at registry-build time, allocates a `Semaphore(MAX_LO_CONCURRENCY)` for each
  engine flagged serialised; non-serialised engines acquire only the global degree permit.
  **`MAX_LO_CONCURRENCY = 1` is a §0.9-owned `pub const` `[DECIDED]`** (the single source
  of the LibreOffice serialisation degree); the §6.7.2 test harness **imports this same
  constant** rather than hard-coding `1`, so the test env can never drift from prod.
  **How the pool gets `serialised_only` from a running job's `EngineId` `[DECIDED]`:**
  the §3.2.3 registry maps `(SourceFmt,TargetFmt) → EngineId`, and the §3.2 `trait
  Engine` exposes **`fn descriptor() -> EngineDescriptor`**; the pool reads
  `registry.engine(engine_id).descriptor().serialised_only` before dispatch (or, at
  registry-build time, pre-computes a `HashMap<EngineId, bool>` of serialised flags
  from each registered engine's `descriptor()`, read on every dispatch). This is the
  named `EngineId → serialised_only` path — there is no descriptor-less lookup gap.
- **FFmpeg internal threading (avoid oversubscription).** FFmpeg's own
  `libx264`/`libvpx` use multiple internal threads per process by default, so even
  the **1–2** video-re-encode cap can saturate the CPU. v1 does **not** additionally
  cap FFmpeg's `-threads` (its internal threading is what makes a single re-encode
  fast); the **1–2** cap is set *because* one or two FFmpeg processes already use
  most cores. Net: video re-encode is effectively serial-ish on typical machines,
  by design — not a bug. (If profiling later shows oversubscription on
  many-core machines, capping `-threads` per process is the lever — recorded, not v1.)
- **Timeout / hang policy parameters.** The pool carries the *parameters* (per-
  engine wall-clock timeout, hang detection via no-progress watchdog); the
  **mechanism** (how a timed-out/hung engine is killed and mapped to §2.8) is
  **owned by §1.7** and referenced here. Defaults are generous for video (a long
  film legitimately takes minutes) and tight for the light engines.
- **Panic isolation.** A worker thread driving a job wraps its body so a Rust-side
  panic surfaces as a clean per-item `Failed` (§2.13 `catch_unwind`/isolate-and-
  report), never poisoning the pool. (Mechanism owned by §2.13.)

**Binding to identity & temp.** Each running job is `(InstanceId, RunId, ItemId)`
(§7.1) and writes only into its **per-run owned scratch** (§2.6/§2.14), so parallel
jobs — and a second app instance, if §7.1 allows one — never collide on temp files
and cleanup never removes another job's in-progress file.

## 0.10 Tauri security boundary — capabilities/permissions allowlist + CSP `[DECIDED]`

This is the **WebView half** of security (the WebView is untrusted; the
capabilities system is the contract for what it may ask the core to do). The
**subprocess/decoder half** is §2.12. Together they form the §0.11 map.

**Capability allowlist (`src-tauri/capabilities/main.json`)** — *deliberately
minimal, deny-by-default.* The WebView is granted **only** what the §0.4 commands
need:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "ConvertIA main window — minimal offline file-converter surface",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",                       // base webview/window/event/path (incl. Channel)
    // — our own #[tauri::command]s C1..C13 need NO per-command permission entry: in
    //   Tauri v2, once a custom command is on the invoke_handler and this capability
    //   covers the "main" window, it is invokable. Per-command permission entries are
    //   ONLY required for PLUGIN commands (dialog/log/store). So we add NO C1..C13
    //   allow-entries here (adding them would be redundant, not load-bearing).
    // C2a pick_for_intake / C2b pick_destination: BOTH native pickers are opened
    //   RUST-SIDE via DialogExt from their handlers `[DECIDED]` — so there is **NO
    //   `dialog:allow-open` grant**. The INTAKE picker (C2a) funnels picked paths
    //   straight into the C1 freeze and returns a CollectedSet, so intake paths never
    //   transit the untrusted WebView (mirrors the opener model). The DESTINATION
    //   picker (C2b) returns the chosen folder PathBuf to the WebView for C5 — that
    //   one WRITE-destination path does transit the WebView (acceptable: §0.11 T2,
    //   bounded by §2.1 non-destructive creates). A Rust-internal DialogExt call is
    //   not capability-gated either way.
    // file-system: the core does the FS work in Rust; the WEBVIEW gets NO fs plugin
    //   scope at all (no fs:default) — it cannot read/write files directly.
    // NO shell:allow-execute — engines spawn Rust-side only (§3.3.3 [DECIDED]); the
    //   WebView is granted no command-execute surface at all. (Removed deliberately;
    //   a raw Rust tokio::process spawn is not capability-gated, so no grant is
    //   needed, and granting one would only re-open the threat §3.3.3 closed.)
    //
    // NO opener:* grant on the WebView either `[DECIDED]`. The "open folder /
    //   open file" affordance (C9) and "open project page" (C10) are ConvertIA's
    //   OWN typed IPC commands; their Rust handlers call the opener plugin's
    //   `OpenerExt` (reveal/open/openUrl) INTERNALLY (§7.7.1). A Rust-internal
    //   `OpenerExt` call is NOT capability-gated (capabilities gate only what the
    //   WebView may invoke), so no `opener:allow-*` permission is required — and
    //   granting one would be the WRONG model here: a static `opener` path scope is
    //   an enforced OUTER bound applied BEFORE any Rust handler runs, so it can only
    //   FURTHER-RESTRICT, never widen. Since the §2.7 default writes output BESIDE
    //   the source (Desktop, USB, arbitrary project folders — routinely outside
    //   $DOWNLOAD/$DOCUMENT), a $DOWNLOAD/$DOCUMENT-scoped grant would SILENTLY
    //   BREAK the one-click open-folder/open-file DoD gate for the common case.
    //   The real, sufficient gate is the Rust-side RunResult-membership check
    //   (§7.7.3): C9 opens a path only if it is in the current run's recorded
    //   outputs (or their common root) — which works for arbitrary beside-source
    //   destinations. C10 is locked to the compiled-in project URL constant in Rust
    //   (no WebView-supplied URL). See §0.4.1 C9/C10, §7.7.2/§7.7.3.
    "log:default",                        // §7.5.1 JS→Rust log bridge (frontend errors → same local file)
    "store:default"                       // §7.4.2 the single settings.json prefs blob (theme + lastDestinationMode + verboseLog)
  ]
}
```

Notes / deliberate exclusions:

- **No `fs:` scope is granted to the WebView.** All filesystem access is Rust-side
  through `guarantees-fs`; the UI never reads or writes files. This is stronger
  than the SSOT minimum and shrinks the threat surface (§0.11).
- **No `http`/`fetch` permission, no updater plugin** → the WebView has **no
  network capability** (reinforces *offline*; §2.11, §7.6).
- **No `shell:allow-execute` at all `[DECIDED]`.** Engines are spawned **only by the
  Rust core** via `tokio::process` (path resolved through the Tauri PathResolver,
  §3.3.3), never from the WebView. There is therefore **no** shell-execute grant on
  the allowlist — the WebView cannot start an engine; the only way to begin a
  conversion is the typed C6 command the core validates against the registry and the
  frozen job. This is the §3.3.3 [DECIDED] resolution; the prior draft's
  `shell:allow-execute` block contradicted it and is removed (it was either dead
  surface-widening or implied a spawn path §1.7 rejects). The Tauri **opener** plugin
  is a *separate* plugin from shell-execute; the opener grants above do **not** grant
  command execution.
- **`opener` is NOT a WebView grant `[DECIDED]`.** C9 (open folder / open file) and
  C10 (open project page) are ConvertIA's own typed IPC commands; their Rust handlers
  call the opener plugin's `OpenerExt` (reveal / open-path / open-url) **internally**.
  A Rust-internal `OpenerExt` call is not capability-gated, so the manifest carries
  **no `opener:allow-*` permission**. The authoritative gate is Rust-side: C9 validates
  the requested path against the current `RunResult`'s recorded outputs (or their common
  root) before opening (§7.7.3 — works for arbitrary beside-source destinations, which a
  static `$DOWNLOAD/$DOCUMENT` scope could never cover), and C10 opens only the
  compiled-in canonical project URL (no WebView-supplied URL, §7.6). `reveal-item-in-dir`
  is the safer primary "open folder" affordance (it does not execute the file); open-path
  is secondary. (Rationale for dropping the static scope: a capability allow-list is an
  enforced **outer** bound applied **before** the Rust handler — it can only further-
  restrict, never widen — so a $DOWNLOAD/$DOCUMENT glob would silently break the
  beside-source open gate, not secure it.)
- **`log:default`** is on the allowlist because §7.5.1 ships a thin JS→Rust log
  bridge (frontend errors land in the same local-only file). It grants **no network**
  — the log sink is a local file; CSP still forbids remote origins.
- **`store:default`** is on the allowlist for the single `settings.json` prefs blob
  (§7.4.2: theme + lastDestinationMode + verboseLog), scoped by the store plugin to that one file.
  Both `log:` and `store:` are local-only and consistent with *offline / no
  system-pollution* (a single OS-config-dir file, no network).

**Content-Security-Policy (`tauri.conf.json → app.security.csp`)** — *recommended,
no remote origins (reinforces "no network"):*

```jsonc
"csp": {
  "default-src": "'self'",
  "script-src": "'self'",
  "style-src": "'self' 'unsafe-inline'",   // Tailwind/inline-style needs; tighten with nonces if feasible
  "img-src": "'self' data: blob:",         // app assets + generated previews/thumbnails as data/blob (NO asset: — v1 renders no user file from disk; §0.10 note)
  "font-src": "'self'",
  "connect-src": "'self' ipc: http://ipc.localhost",  // Tauri v2 IPC custom protocol ONLY — NO https/remote
  "media-src": "'self' blob:",             // generated content only (NO asset:)
  "object-src": "'none'",
  "base-uri": "'self'",
  "form-action": "'self'",                 // no form POST to a remote target
  "webrtc": "'block'",                     // best-effort: blocks RTCPeerConnection on Chromium/WebView2; likely a no-op on macOS WKWebView / Linux WebKitGTK (spec default 'allow')
  "frame-src": "'none'"
}
```

- **No remote origin appears anywhere** in the CSP — **no ordinary fetch/XHR/
  WebSocket/remote-subresource network is possible** from the WebView (the only
  `connect-src` is the Tauri IPC protocol; `form-action 'self'` blocks remote form
  POST; `webrtc 'block'` is **best-effort** — it blocks the RTCPeerConnection channel
  on Chromium/WebView2 but is **likely a no-op on macOS WKWebView and Linux WebKitGTK**
  (those engines default the directive to 'allow'), so it cannot be relied on
  cross-platform). CSP alone does **not** close every exotic side channel (DNS-prefetch,
  CSS-based timing, the WebRTC gap above), so the **load-bearing** cross-WebView
  offline enforcement is **§3.3.4 nothing-to-fetch** (the app opens no socket) + the
  **§2.11.4 packet-monitor release gate** (the actual proof; §2.12.3 engine-side OS
  network-deny is the **best-effort privilege-drop tier** `[DECIDED]` — defence-in-depth
  that degrades silently to the cheap tier, **not** the load-bearing guarantee). The CSP
  is the observable WebView-side form of
  *Local/private/offline* (verified in §2.11 / §6.4); the §2.11.4 packet gate is the
  load-bearing proof. **Accepted residual `[DECIDED]`:** the `webrtc 'block'` no-op on 2
  of 3 WebView engines is an **explicitly-accepted residual** — even if a WKWebView/
  WebKitGTK WebRTC channel could be opened, the WebView has **no filesystem/path access**
  (no `asset:`, no `fs:` plugin, no path ever reaches it for the intake picker, §0.4.1
  C2a), so it has **nothing local to exfiltrate**; the real bound is the **no-WebView-FS
  model + §3.3.4 nothing-to-fetch + the §2.11.4 packet gate**, not the CSP directive. The
  residual therefore costs nothing and is not chased with a per-engine workaround.
- **No `asset:` protocol.** `asset:` is dropped from `img-src`/`media-src`: v1 renders
  **no** user file from disk in the WebView (there is no preview feature in §05), it
  would contradict the no-WebView-FS model, and the asset protocol would additionally
  need `assetProtocol.enable` + a scope + an `asset.localhost` CSP host on Windows
  (none declared). `data:`/`blob:` remain for app-generated content only. A future
  in-WebView preview would be a `[DEFER]` that re-adds `asset:` with the required
  config.
- `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is the one pragmatic loosening (Tailwind + React
  inline styles); tightening to nonces is a polish item, not a gate. (Note: the
  platform "no inline CSS" rule targets hand-authored stylesheets; framework-
  emitted styles under a locked CSP are the accepted exception here.)

**Status `[DECIDED]`.** The allowlist shape **and** its concrete contents are now
fixed: deny-by-default; **no** WebView FS; **no** network; **no `shell:allow-execute`**
(engines spawn Rust-side per §3.3.3); **no `opener:*` WebView grant** (C9/C10 are
ConvertIA's own commands whose Rust handlers call `OpenerExt` internally — not
capability-gated — and the real gate is the Rust-side §7.7.3 RunResult-membership
check, which works for arbitrary beside-source outputs a static scope could not);
**no `dialog:allow-open` WebView grant** `[DECIDED]` (both C2 pickers are opened
Rust-side via `DialogExt`: the **intake** picker C2a funnels picked paths into the C1
freeze and returns a `CollectedSet`, so **intake** paths never transit the WebView;
the **destination** picker C2b returns the chosen write-destination `PathBuf` to the
WebView for C5, which is acceptable per §0.11 T2). **Scope note — the "WebView never
sees raw FS paths" claim is precise, not absolute:** it holds for the *picker* intake
surface, but the **primary intake (drag-and-drop) structurally delivers raw paths to
the WebView** via Tauri's native `onDragDropEvent` Drop payload (§1.1/§5.4), and the
**OS launch-arg / `app://intake`** path emits `Vec<PathBuf>` to the WebView that it
echoes back to C1. The real mitigation is **not** "no path ever reaches the WebView"
but that the **core treats every WebView-supplied path (drop, launch-arg, and a C5
destination) as untrusted input re-validated at the §1.1 freeze / §2.3.3 write-target
check** (canonicalise / resolve-identity / existence / detection); the DialogExt
picker simply avoids *one extra* such surface and the `dialog:allow-open` grant.
`log:default` + `store:default` for the §7.5 local log
bridge and the §7.4 prefs blob. The image-core runs as a **separate image-worker
process** `[DECIDED]` (§0.7/§2.12/§3.5.5) — a raw Rust spawn, so it adds **no**
WebView capability regardless. The
former `[OPEN]` (shell scope WebView-exposed vs Rust-only) is **closed: Rust-only,
no shell grant** (§3.3.3). Cross-refs: §3.3.3 (spawn model), §7.4 (store), §7.5 (log),
§7.7 (opener scope it constrains).

## 0.11 Security model & threat-surface map

One assembled map. The pieces are **owned elsewhere**; this section's job is to
prove **coverage** — every threat class has a named owner and no class is orphaned.
The `SECURITY` policy (§6.8) references this map.

| # | Threat class | Vector | Owner (mechanism) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | **Untrusted decoder input** | A crafted/corrupt/malicious file (image bomb, malformed MP4, hostile SVG, macro-laden DOCX) exploits or hangs a decoder | **§2.12** decoder isolation (separate subprocess for **every** engine including the image core — the image-worker process `[DECIDED]` §0.7/§3.5.5; contained crash/hang/exploit fails one item) + **§1.7** invocation lifecycle (timeout/kill) + **§0.9** pool bounds + **§1.2** detection security note (first code on untrusted bytes). **v1 ships no rely-on-OS decode path**; any future rely-on-OS untrusted-decode must pass the **§3.4.4** re-evaluation gate before counting as T1-covered. | covered |
| T2 | **Malicious / compromised WebView content** | XSS-style injection or a supply-chained frontend dep tries to read the disk or call out | **§0.10** capability allowlist (no WebView `fs`, no network) + CSP (no remote origins, `object-src 'none'`) | covered |
| T2a | **WebView steers writes to an attacker-chosen path** | A compromised WebView supplies an arbitrary `DestinationChoice::ChosenRoot(PathBuf)` to C5/C6 (the destination is WebView-held, with no server-side store — §0.4.1 C6) to write outputs somewhere unexpected | **§2.1** writes are always **non-destructive creates** (never overwrite) + **§2.3.3** write-target link-safety (a chosen destination that resolves onto / inside a frozen source is rejected and diverted) + **§2.7** divert rules. A chosen destination is honoured only as a *write* location: it **cannot harm an original** (no-clobber + link-safe) and **cannot read anything** — so an arbitrary writable ChosenRoot is bounded harm (a converted copy lands in an odd-but-writable folder), accepted in v1. The C2b destination picker is Rust-opened, but C5/C6 still accept a WebView-supplied `ChosenRoot` string; the no-harm machinery — not path provenance — is the bound. | covered |
| T3 | **Bundled-binary supply chain** | A tampered/backdoored engine binary ships in the build | **§3.8** engine pinning + **§6.2** integrity hashes + **§6.3** SBOM (every binary enumerated, verifiable) | covered |
| T4 | **Open-file launch of a fresh artifact** | C9 "open file" hands a just-written, possibly-still-untrusted output to an external app | **§7.7** open-file safety (reveal-in-folder, no auto-open, the artifact is *our* output not the untrusted source) + **§7.7.3** Rust-side `RunResult`-membership check (only a path that is a member of the current run's results may be opened). (Note: §0.10/§7.7.2 deliberately grant **no** `opener:*` path scope — beside-source outputs legitimately write outside `$DOWNLOAD`/`$DOCUMENT` — so the gate is the membership check, not a capability path-scope.) | covered |
| T5 | **Core panic / app fault** | A Rust panic, WebView load failure, missing/corrupt engine at startup, damaged bundle | **§2.13** app-level fault model (`catch_unwind` worker boundary, no-stack-trace surfacing) + **§7.2** startup faults + **§0.3.1** WebView-absent handling | covered |
| T6 | **Copyleft aggregation boundary** | Accidentally linking a GPL/LGPL engine into the MIT core (licence contamination) | **§3.6** copyleft isolation (separate invoked binaries, aggregation not linking) — architecturally enforced by the §0.3 subprocess model + §0.7 (engines are sidecars, never linked) | covered |
| T7 | **Path / link redirection** | A symlink/junction/alias makes an output resolve onto a source, or a TOCTOU race redirects the final write | **§2.3** resolved-identity & link safety + **§2.1** exclusive create-new-or-fail (the no-clobber guarantee is evaluated on the resolved real file) | covered |
| T8 | **Self-feeding / batch expansion** | Outputs written into a watched source folder get re-ingested, or a second instance's files appear mid-run | **§2.4** frozen source set + **§7.1** instance/run identity (per-run temp ownership, no cross-instance ingestion) | covered |
| T9a | **ConvertIA's own code exfiltrates user files** | The app itself (Rust core or WebView) tries to upload originals/results | **Structurally covered:** ConvertIA's own code **opens no socket** — no HTTP/updater plugin on the §0.10 allowlist, no `connect-src` to remote origins (CSP), `form-action 'self'`, no phone-home (**§7.6**). The only network is the user-initiated C10 open-project-page shell-out. Proven by the **§2.11.4** packet-monitor release gate (blocks release on any outbound packet) + **§2.11** offline invariant. | covered |
| T9b | **A bundled engine reaches out on hostile input** | A crafted dropped file makes a bundled engine (FFmpeg HLS/DASH/concat, pandoc include, LibreOffice remote/OLE link, **a crafted SVG's `<image href>`/XInclude**) open an outbound socket or read an out-of-input file at convert time (SSRF/LFR; e.g. CVE-2023-6605, librsvg CVE-2023-38633) | **Load-bearing argv/build controls (NOT the degradable OS sandbox), BOTH halves:** **§3.5.1** FFmpeg `-protocol_whitelist file,pipe` + network-disabled build (SSRF half) **and** concat `-safe 1` (never `-safe 0`, rejects absolute/`..` paths) + a curated demuxer set without the playlist/manifest dereferencing demuxers (absolute-file LFR half) — both asserted at **§6.1.3** (`ffmpeg -protocols` + `-demuxers`); **§3.5.4** pandoc `--sandbox`; **§3.5.2** LibreOffice profile-hardening (no link/OLE auto-update); **§3.5.5** SVG/librsvg control — stage the SVG into per-job scratch on ALL platforms + base-URL-confine href/XInclude resolution to scratch + refuse external resource loads (closes the SVG absolute-file LFR half, the librsvg analogue of the FFmpeg LFR control). Backed by the **§6.4.2** adversarial-egress / network-trigger case (zero egress AND no out-of-input file read on a network-trigger input), the **§6.1.3** SVG external-`<image href>` corpus assertion (no out-of-input bytes embedded), and proven again by the **§2.11.4** packet-monitor gate. **Defence-in-depth only (no longer load-bearing for either half):** **§2.12.3** engine-side OS network/FS restriction — the **best-effort privilege-drop tier** `[DECIDED]` (present where it works without install-time elevation, **degrades silently to the cheap tier** otherwise), so it is **not** the structural guarantee; the per-engine argv/build controls are. | covered |
| T10 | **Resource exhaustion / DoS-by-input** | A tiny SVG asked to render at 50 000 px, a 90-min→GIF, a thousands-file batch exhausting RAM/disk/handles | **§1.10** resource pre-flight & budgets + **§0.9** pool/handle bounds + the to-GIF guardrail (cross-category.md) | covered |

**No orphan classes.** Every box above points at a section that owns the
mechanism; this file invents none of them. If a new threat class is identified
during implementation it is added here with an owner before code lands (the map is
the coverage contract the §6.8 `SECURITY` policy points at).
