# P7 — Documents · Spreadsheets · Presentations (office family)

> **Full document/spreadsheet/presentation coverage on the proven P4 harness.**

> **pandoc** (markup down/up-conversions for the XML/text sources), and the
> **native Rust CSV/TSV engine** (already built end-to-end in P3 — only *broadened*

## Boundaries (read against P3 + P4)

- **P3 ↔ P7:** P3 built the **native CSV/TSV engine** (streamed pass, encoding/
  delimiter sniff, RFC-4180 re-quote, CSV-injection literal-preservation) and the
  §1.2 detection-dispatcher skeleton with the CSV/TSV text path + first KAT entries.
  **P7 broadens** the text path with the office container signatures (OOXML/ODF/OLE2
  disambiguation) and wires the LO-owned CSV/TSV *workbook* pairs — it must **not**
  re-implement the native transform, the text sniff, or the detection dispatcher.
- **P4 ↔ P7:** P4 built the **generic** harness (isolation wrapper, lifecycle, the
  per-pair runner + ledger + bijection guard, options-panel shell, SBOM/NOTICE
  scaffold, §6.1.3 framework, startup verifier, macOS TCC staging, the engine-asset
  cache + `stage-engines` skeleton). **P7 fills the office-specific variants:** the
  three engines' staging + hardening + `engines.lock`/SBOM rows + §6.1.3 assertion
  lists + §7.2.3 availability rows, every office pair, the corpus, the per-pair
  tests, the option **declarations** (chrome already built), the bundled-font
  staging, and the per-engine SSRF/LFR hardening (LO profile, pandoc `--sandbox`,
  poppler no-network). P7 must **not** rebuild the panel chrome, the runner, the
  ledger generator, the isolation wrapper, or the patent matrix.

## Internal §6.5 sub-gates (intra-phase milestones)

LibreOffice is the shared workhorse of all three categories and the size driver of
the whole product, so it is staged + hardened **first** and a §6.5 sub-gate marks
**every spreadsheet + presentation pair `reliable`** (the LO-only categories) before
the document category — whose pandoc/poppler engines and the `MD→PDF` ship-or-park
gate add the remaining risk — is attempted. The sub-gate boxes sit between the
clusters and `needs:` their cluster's pair boxes.

### LibreOffice engine staging, hardening & runtime wiring

> The LibreOffice headless sidecar (program tree + disposable-profile template +
> bundled fonts) must exist, be hardened (the disposable `-env:UserInstallation`
> profile, the `registrymodifications.xcu` macro/link/Calc-external pins),
> checksum-verified, SBOM/NOTICE-rowed and runtime-wired through the §2.12 boundary
> before any office pair can be built. These boxes execute the per-engine variants
> of the P0.7-policy / P4-framework gates for LibreOffice specifically.

- [ ] **P7.1** [BUILD] Stage the LibreOffice headless program tree as a `bundle.resources` dir per-OS (cache-keyed) · §3.3.1 §3.3.2 §6.1.3 · G37
  needs: P4.27
  > `scripts/stage-engines` restores the `actions/cache`-hosted `libreoffice-<ver>-<triple>` engine-asset cache (checksum-verified pinned-URL fetch on a miss) and places the LibreOffice **directory tree** (`program/soffice.bin` launcher + `program/`, `share/`, type libraries) under `src-tauri/engines/libreoffice/` as a `bundle.resources` map (NOT `externalBin` — it is a tree, not a single self-contained exe, §3.3.1). The one MPL-2.0 binary serves documents/spreadsheets/presentations. → executes the P0.7.3/P0.7.4 acquisition+staging policy for LibreOffice.
- [ ] **P7.2** [BUILD] Stage the §3.9.3 bundled-font baseline beside the LibreOffice sidecar · §3.9.3 §6.1.3 · G37 G35 G36
  needs: P7.1
  > stage the `[DECIDED]` baseline font set under `src-tauri/fonts/` as `bundle.resources` — Liberation + Carlito + Caladea (metric-compatible Arial/Calibri/Cambria/Times/Courier) + the curated Noto subset (Sans/Serif CJK-SC/TC/JP/KR Regular + Noto Sans Arabic/Hebrew) so LibreOffice substitution is graceful and non-Latin text never tofus; the single biggest fidelity lever for all three categories; each font is a first-class `engines.lock`/SBOM row (SHA-256 + SPDX OFL-1.1/Apache-2.0 + source URL — the Liberation OFL-1.1 trap, Carlito/Caladea Apache-2.0, Noto CJK OFL-1.1). CJK weight breadth is the `[DEFER: size]` knob, not a design call.
- [ ] **P7.3** [BUILD] Anchor the LibreOffice acquisition + add its `engines.lock` row + SBOM/NOTICE rows · §3.7.2 §3.8 · G37 G35 G36
  needs: P7.1
  > add the LibreOffice `engines.lock` row (`purl` `pkg:generic/libreoffice@<ver>` + SHA-256 + a CPE where one exists) per the P0.7.3 acquisition policy (from-source signed-tarball OR ≥2-mirror/distro-signed prebuilt corroboration); populate the CycloneDX SBOM + `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES` rows for LibreOffice MPL-2.0 + its many bundled components (Syft cross-check); the bundled security-CONFIG file `registrymodifications.xcu` (P7.5) is itself a first-class `engines.lock` row (SHA-256 + SPDX + source). → executes the P0.7.1/P0.7.3 policy for LibreOffice.
- [ ] **P7.4** [RUST] Wire the LibreOffice invocation through the §2.12 isolation boundary with the minimal-env + loader-strip + cwd=scratch contract · §3.5.2 §2.12 §2.14 · G29
  needs: P7.1, P4.13
  > register LibreOffice in the §3.2 `Engine` registry (`EngineProgram::ResourceBin`, resolved via `app.path().resolve("engines/libreoffice/program/soffice", BaseDirectory::Resource)` — NOT externalBin); route every invocation through the P4 §2.12 isolation wrapper with cwd = per-run scratch (§2.14), minimal isolated env (`LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`, no proxy vars, `PATH` not relied on — absolute bundled path), and the explicit dynamic-loader-injection strip (`LD_PRELOAD`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`/`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` cleared, G29 `.env_clear()` invariant). Untrusted office files (zip-bomb OPC, malformed OOXML, macro-bearing) parsed in LO = classic T1 attack surface.
- [ ] **P7.5** [BUILD] Author + seed the disposable `-env:UserInstallation` profile + the hardened `registrymodifications.xcu` (macros + links) · §3.5.2 §0.11 · G38 G37
  needs: P7.1
  > the T1-macro-RCE control: pre-seed the disposable per-run profile template with a `registrymodifications.xcu` pinning **macro security at the highest level** (`…/Security/Scripting/MacroSecurityLevel = 3` disable-all-without-notification + `DisableMacrosExecution = true`, no Basic IDE — macros never run, no prompt blocks headless) and **no link auto-update on load** (`LinkUpdateMode = 0` so external-reference/DDE/remote-OLE links don't fetch on load) and **no remote/OLE auto-fetch**. The §6.1.3 build assertion checks the staged `.xcu` carries these keys (P7.7). The concrete mechanism behind every category's "macros never executed / dropped" policy.
- [ ] **P7.6** [BUILD] Pin the Calc external-data / WEBSERVICE / external-reference T9b profile keys (best-effort, defence-in-depth) · §3.5.2 §0.11 · G38
  needs: P7.5
  > extend the `registrymodifications.xcu` with the Calc T9b external-data vectors (best-effort): **no external-data-range refresh on load**, **no external-reference recalculation on load** (`…/Office/Calc/.../Load` external-reference update off), **linked-object/DDE auto-update off** (composing with `LinkUpdateMode = 0`). These are **defence-in-depth, not the load-bearing proof** — the office-engine T9b half leans on the §2.11.4 packet-monitor gate + the §6.4.2 adversarial-egress Calc case (a crafted `.xlsx` with a `WEBSERVICE`/external-data trigger → zero egress AND no out-of-input read) for its release-blocking proof, exactly as FFmpeg/pandoc are corpus-proven.
- [ ] **P7.7** [BUILD] Add the LibreOffice §6.1.3 build assertions — profile keys present + filter availability + no-network · §6.1.3 §3.5.2 · G38
  needs: P7.5, P4.51
  > the per-engine §6.1.3 assertion list (fills the P4 generic framework): parse the staged `registrymodifications.xcu` and FAIL the build if the macro-disable / `LinkUpdateMode=0` / Calc-external keys (P7.5/P7.6) are absent; assert the staged LO build is **not** wired for network link-fetch; assert every filter name ConvertIA invokes (P7.8) exists in the staged build (the exposed-parameter capability assertion). → executes the P0.7.4 per-engine build-assertion policy for LibreOffice.
- [ ] **P7.8** [RUST] Wire the LibreOffice invocation SHELL — argv assembly, `--outdir`, headless/nolockcheck/disposable-profile flags · §3.5.2 · G31
  needs: P7.4
  > the §3.5.2 argv SHELL (pure Rust dispatch — no filter-name data): `soffice --headless --norestore --nolockcheck --nodefault --nofirststartwizard -env:UserInstallation=file://<per-run-profile> --convert-to <ext>:<FilterName>[:<FilterData-JSON>] --outdir <unique-empty-scratch> <input>` — the command-line / arg-vector construction, the `--outdir` slot, the flag set, and the `<FilterName>`/`<FilterData-JSON>` token *positions* (the values come from P7.9/P7.14). P7.10–P7.16 build on this invocation shape. Split from the filter-name table (P7.9): an invocation-shape error fails a different check than a filter-table error, and P7.10–P7.16 need only the invocation shape while P7.14 (FilterData assembly) also needs the filter names.
- [ ] **P7.9** [RUST] Wire the fixed LibreOffice filter-name table for all LO-owned categories (the data-driven registry) · §3.5.2 · G31
  needs: P7.4
  > the fixed filter-name registry (a data-driven table with its own serialization/validation, distinct from the P7.8 invocation shell) — `*→PDF`: `writer_pdf_Export`/`calc_pdf_Export`/`impress_pdf_Export`; office↔office: `MS Word 2007 XML`/`MS Word 97`/`writer8`/`Rich Text Format`, `Calc MS Excel 2007 XML`/`MS Excel 97`/`calc8`, `Impress MS PowerPoint 2007 XML`/`MS PowerPoint 97`/`impress8`; CSV/TSV: `Text - txt - csv (StarCalc)` + FilterOptions token string; DOC→markup: `Text`/`HTML (StarWriter)`/`Markdown`†. The per-pair filter VALUES are owned by the §04 files; this box owns the canonical name→filter map the P7.8 invocation interpolates and the P7.14 FilterData assembly references.
- [ ] **P7.10** [RUST] Wire the one-document-per-invocation + per-run disposable-profile + §0.9 LibreOffice serialization · §3.5.2 §0.9 §2.6 · G31
  needs: P7.8
  > each LO job gets its **own** disposable `-env:UserInstallation` profile in per-run scratch (§2.14), torn down with the run (§2.6); the §0.9 pool reads `descriptor().serialised_only = true` for LibreOffice and acquires the single-permit semaphore BEFORE spawn (parallel instances on one profile lock/corrupt) — one document per invocation, serialized. The §3.2.2 `EngineDescriptor.serialised_only` data path the pool depends on is populated here for LO.
- [ ] **P7.11** [RUST] Wire the LibreOffice output discovery via unique-empty-outdir snapshot-diff (never source-basename match) · §3.5.2 §2.1 · G31
  needs: P7.8
  > the §3.5.2 `[DECIDED]` discovery rule: LO normalises/truncates basenames, so the core must NOT string-match the source basename. Each job gets a **unique, empty, per-job `--outdir`** under per-run scratch; discovery = snapshot-diff (list outdir empty before spawn, list after verified success, pick the single new `*.<ext>` file); that discovered file is atomic-published to the planned final name (§2.1) — LO's own output naming is never the user-facing name.
- [ ] **P7.12** [RUST] Wire the LibreOffice exit-0-but-wrote-nothing success verification + the password-protected → §2.8 mapping · §3.5.2 §2.8 · G31
  needs: P7.11
  > the critical correctness rule: LO headless returns **exit 0 even on some failures** and writes nothing → success is verified by the expected output file **existing and being non-empty** in `--outdir`, NOT by exit code. **Zero** new files despite exit 0 → mapped per the stderr rule; encrypted/password files → no output → the §2.8 "password-protected" kind (shared by documents/spreadsheets/presentations); a stale soffice lock avoided by the per-run profile + `--nolockcheck`.
- [ ] **P7.13** [RUST] Wire the LibreOffice exit/stderr → §2.8 error-kind mapping (`classify_failure`) + cancellation + no-partial-output · §3.5.2 §2.8 §1.7 §2.1 · G31
  needs: P7.12
  > map LO stderr/no-output patterns to §2.8 kinds (password-protected; corrupt/partial OPC zip or CFB → corrupt; generic → plain-language engine-failure §2.13); cancellation via §1.7 process-group kill (a cancelled LO job leaves NO partial output — LO writes into the scratch outdir, atomic-published only on verified non-empty success); a crashing/hanging LO fails THAT one item and the batch continues (§1.9).
- [ ] **P7.14** [RUST] Wire the FilterData-JSON PDF-export option assembly (shared by all `*→PDF`) · §3.5.2 §1.6 · G31
  needs: P7.8, P7.9
  > assemble the inline FilterData JSON for the PDF export filters — e.g. `pdf:impress_pdf_Export:{"ExportNotesPages":{"type":"boolean","value":"true"}}`; the typed→JSON wire form for `SelectPdfVersion`/`UseTaggedPDF`/`Quality`/`ExportBookmarks`/`ReduceImageResolution`/`ExportNotesPages`/`MaxImageResolution`/`UseLosslessCompression`/`EmbedStandardFonts`; the per-category default VALUES are owned by the §04 files (P7.25/P7.44) — this box owns only the assembly, with a `PlanError` (range) for an out-of-range value.
- [ ] **P7.15** [TEST] Add the per-engine LibreOffice §7.2.3 availability/integrity rows + the in-bundle hash-manifest entries · §7.2.3 · G46 G37
  needs: P7.3, P4.43
  > populate the LibreOffice launcher + program-tree + bundled-font rows in the build-time in-bundle hash manifest and the `EngineHealth` availability table (the per-engine variant of the P4 startup-verifier framework) so a missing/corrupt LibreOffice escalates to a §2.13 app-fault not a crash, and feeds C12 `get_engine_health` (§5.2 disables the office targets if LO is unavailable — all three categories depend on it).
- [ ] **P7.16** [RUST] Verify LibreOffice receives the macOS kind-2 scratch-staged source + the staged `--outdir` rule · §3.5.0 §7.2.6 §2.14.2 · G31 G29
  needs: P7.4, P4.24
  > assert (macOS only) the core stages the dropped source into per-job kind-2 scratch BEFORE spawning LO and hands LO the SCRATCH path as `<input>` (with `--outdir` already at scratch), so a spawned engine is never the first process to touch a TCC-protected Desktop/Documents/Downloads/removable path (T11); composes with §2.14 cross-volume + the §1.10 macOS staged-input preflight. The `stage_for_tcc`-before-spawn invariant (G29 Semgrep rule) holds for the LO `Command::new`.

### poppler `pdftotext` engine staging, hardening & wiring (PDF→TXT)

> The single PDF-consuming engine. Separate invoked GPL binary; no Ghostscript
> backstop (`[DECIDED: dropped v1]`); poppler-only with a clean fail-clearly on the
> unrecoverable minority. One pair: `PDF→TXT`.

- [ ] **P7.17** [BUILD] Stage the poppler `pdftotext` sidecar per-OS + add its `engines.lock`/SBOM/NOTICE rows · §3.3 §3.7.2 §3.8 · G37 G35 G36
  needs: P4.27, P0.7.3
  > `scripts/stage-engines` restores the `poppler-<ver>-<triple>` cache (checksum-verified pinned-URL on miss; the from-source built-without-network populate path is P7.17.1), places `pdftotext` under `src-tauri/binaries/` target-triple-suffixed, declares it in `tauri.conf.json` `bundle.externalBin`; add the `engines.lock` row (`purl` `pkg:generic/poppler@<ver>` + SHA-256 + poppler CPE) per the P0.7.3 policy; SBOM/`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES` rows with the **valid SPDX expression `GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only`** (not the bare `GPL-2.0/GPL-3.0` — §6.3.3 rejects unresolved) + the GPL written-offer-of-source corresponding-source pointer line. → executes P0.7.1/P0.7.3 for poppler (`needs: P0.7.3` for the from-source acquisition + engine-source-allow-list policy this anchors against; the cross-phase edge carried via the P7.77 reconciliation box).
  - [ ] **P7.17.1** [BUILD] Compile poppler `pdftotext` from source as the built-without-network / no-Ghostscript build via the P4.28.1 harness (fills the poppler configure-flag manifest seam) · §6.1.3 §3.5.3 §3.1 · G37
    needs: P4.28.1
    > the from-source poppler build the **P7.18 built-without-network + no-Ghostscript §6.1.3 assertions can only pass against** where a stock prebuilt enables a network fetch path or pulls a Ghostscript backstop (AGPL surface): compile poppler/`pdftotext` through the **P4.28.1 from-source compilation harness** with the curated configure flags (no network/remote-URI fetch path so a crafted PDF referencing a remote resource produces no egress — the §3.4.3 remote-URI sentinel; no Ghostscript dependency, the §3.1/§3.6 AGPL-free posture), filling the P4.28.1 per-engine `poppler.configure.flags` manifest seam so the configure line is the data P7.18 cross-checks; populate the `poppler-<ver>-<triple>` cache key P7.17 staging reads. (Where a distro-signed prebuilt provably ships built-without-network + GS-free, the P0.7.3 prebuilt corroboration branch may anchor it instead — but the assertion still tests the curated property, so the from-source compile is the satisfiable path when no such prebuilt exists.) (`needs: P4.28.1` for the from-source harness; the cross-phase edge carried via the P7.77 reconciliation box.)

- [ ] **P7.20** [RUST] Wire the poppler exit/stderr → §2.8 mapping (encrypted/empty-extraction/unrecoverable) + `classify_failure` · §3.5.3 §2.8 · G31
  needs: P7.19
  > map `pdftotext` outcomes: non-zero / "Command Line Error: Incorrect password" on an encrypted no-user-password PDF → the §2.8 "password-protected" kind (no password ever prompted/cracked); **empty extraction** (scanned/image PDF, no OCR in v1) → a valid-but-near-empty `.txt` reported honestly, **not** an error and **not** a misleading success of an empty file; an unrecoverable PDF → fail clearly (§2.8), batch continues (no GS repair backstop in v1).

### pandoc engine staging, hardening & wiring (markup conversions)

> The markup engine for the XML/text sources (`DOCX/ODT/RTF/MD/HTML/TXT ↔`). Always
> `--sandbox` (the cheap-tier SSRF/LFR control). pandoc **cannot** read legacy
> binary `.doc` (those down-conversions are LO-owned, P7.40); the registry never
> hands pandoc a `.doc`. The `RTF→markup` ownership is a `[DEFER: corpus]` (pandoc
> default, LO fallback) resolved by P7.63.

- [ ] **P7.23** [BUILD] Stage the pandoc sidecar per-OS + add its `engines.lock`/SBOM/NOTICE rows + the `--version ≥ 2.15` floor · §3.3 §3.7.2 §3.8 §6.1.3 · G37 G35 G36 G38
  needs: P4.27
  > `scripts/stage-engines` restores the `pandoc-<ver>-<triple>` cache (checksum-verified pinned-URL on miss), places `pandoc` under `src-tauri/binaries/` target-triple-suffixed, declares it in `bundle.externalBin`; add the `engines.lock` row (`purl` `pkg:generic/pandoc@<ver>` + SHA-256 + pandoc CPE) + SBOM/`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES` rows (GPL-2.0+ + written-offer corresponding-source pointer); the §6.1.3 build assertion asserts the staged pandoc reports **`--version ≥ 2.15`** (the `--sandbox` floor) and FAILS the build below it. → executes P0.7.1/P0.7.3/P0.7.4 for pandoc.
- [ ] **P7.24** [RUST] Wire pandoc through the §2.12 boundary + the always-on `--sandbox` SSRF/LFR control · §3.5.4 §3.3.4 §2.12 §0.11 · G29 G42 G42b

This is the load-bearing markup-engine SSRF/LFR control (the §3.3.4 "pandoc fetches nothing" claim) — corpus-proven by the §6.4.2 adversarial-egress case, not the registry. No pandoc Lua/JSON filters and no pandoc PDF production configured (so the documented `--sandbox` gaps don't apply).

  > wire the §6.5.4 rule for the LibreOffice / pandoc / poppler / bundled-font `engines.lock` pins: a version/SHA change re-runs the FULL P7 reliability gate before that engine version can ship (a patch must not silently regress a pair — incl. a LO bump that could change the 26.2 Markdown-import behaviour P7.71 gated on); the ledger status-diff is part of the bump review; the informational per-push OSV/grype over the PURL/CPE-keyed LO/poppler rows (poppler/LibreOffice are real CVE surfaces) feeds vuln-response (CVSS ≥ 7 on an exercised office path → release-blocking escalation).

### Cross-phase reconciliation (the deferred P7→P4 harness edges)

- [ ] **P7.77** [GATE] Wire the deferred P7→P4 harness reconciliation `needs:` edges — isolation boundary, §1.7 progress/classify, per-pair runner + ledger + bijection, TCC staging, verifier, options-panel shell · §3.5.2 · G7 G20
  needs: P4.8, P4.13, P4.14, P4.24, P4.25, P4.43, P4.49, P4.59, P4.60, P4.61, P4.64, P4.74, P4.28.1, P0.7.3, P0.7.4
  > the P7 instance of the cross-phase reconciliation obligation (the master plan-lint forbidden-string check is P4.77; reciprocal of P3.70/P5.74/P6.92/P9.46): declare the load-bearing P7→P4 + P7→P0 edges the office-family boxes consume — the office staging executes the **P0.7.3 engine-acquisition + allow-list policy** (P7.1/P7.17/the pandoc staging) and the per-engine §6.1.3 assertions execute the **P0.7.4 build-assertion policy** (P7.18 + the LO/pandoc assertion boxes); the from-source poppler built-without-network compile (P7.17.1) fills the **P4.28.1 from-source compilation harness** configure-flag manifest seam (the curated build the P7.18 §6.1.3 assertion can only pass against); every LibreOffice/poppler/pandoc invocation routes through the **P4.13/P4.14 §2.12 isolation wrapper** (P7.4/P7.19/P7.23, inline edges already on those boxes) + handles progress/stderr-classify through the **P4.8 §1.7 line-reader + P4.49 classify seam**; macOS TCC source-staging is **P4.24/P4.25** (the read-side staging for the office sidecars); the per-engine availability rows populate the **P4.43 verifier framework** (P7.17/P7.24, inline); every per-pair test runs on the **P4.59 §6.4.3 runner** (P7.51/P7.62/P7.69 consume it — the deferred edge owned here, no per-box inline) and the phase/sub-gates drive the **P4.60 bijection guard + P4.61 ledger generator** (P7.63/P7.74/P7.75); the zip-slip archive-entry-name `cargo-fuzz` target (P7.50.1) instantiates the **P0.4.3 zip-slip G48 leg** over the P7.30 bounded in-core OPC parse (inline `needs: P0.4.3, P7.30`); every advanced-option DECLARATION box (P7.58/P7.59.1/P7.59.2/P7.67) renders against the **P4.64 OptionsPanel widget dispatch + the P4.74 AdvancedDrawer** (inline edges on those boxes). `needs:` these P4 harness boxes here so the §6 selection builds the P4 mechanism first (P4 is `[x]` before the loop reaches P7 — the edges must RESOLVE, not dangle; the inline engine/declaration edges on P7.4–P7.67 carry the per-box dependency, this box is the auditable single owner for the runner/ledger/bijection edges P7.51/P7.62/P7.69/P7.74 do not inline). No P7 box `>`-note defers a `needs:` with the P4.77-forbidden phrasing.
