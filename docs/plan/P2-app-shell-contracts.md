# P2 — App Shell & Pipeline Contracts

> **The spine + the contracts (on top of the P1 scaffold).** P2 stands up the
> running-app **behaviour** the P1 shell can't carry — the window/quit lifecycle,
> single-instance + run identity, the §7.8 OS-intake funnel, persistence, logging —
> and the **detect → plan → convert → publish** contracts: the C1–C13 IPC surface,
> the §0.6 domain types, the error model, the §1.1 intake state machine, the §7.2.1
> ordered startup-sequence spine, and the C12 `EngineHealth` contract — **type-shared
> end-to-end Rust↔TS with NO real engine yet**. P3 (walking skeleton) builds the
> first conversion *through* these contracts; P4 builds the runtime engine-health
> probe that *populates* C12.
>
> Spec homes: [00-architecture](../spec/00-architecture.md) (§0.3/§0.4/§0.6/§0.7/
> §0.9/§0.10), [01-conversion-pipeline](../spec/01-conversion-pipeline.md)
> (§1.1 intake state machine, §1.11 IPC-responsiveness), [07-app-shell](../spec/07-app-shell.md)
> (§7.1 instance/run identity + single-instance, §7.2 startup-sequence ordering +
> C12 `EngineHealth`, §7.3 window lifecycle, §7.4 persistence, §7.5 logging,
> §7.6 no-updater, §7.7 shell-out, §7.8 OS-intake funnel + §7.8.2 negatives).
> Index: [plan/README.md](README.md). Box format: [`_format.md`](_format.md).
>
> **This is the v0 base.** The atomic `[ ]` boxes below derive exhaustively from
> the spec homes; a later adversarial review deepens, splits and completes them.
>
> **Boundaries (read against P1).** P1 already **scaffolded everything structural** —
> the workspace `Cargo.toml` + `src-tauri` crate (P1.6), the §0.7 module tree as
> downward-only shells incl. the G9 assertion (P1.11), the React/TS/Vite/Tailwind
> frontend (P1.29–P1.31), `index.html` + the `x-dns-prefetch-control:off` meta
> (P1.23), `strings/ui.ts` (P1.37), `tauri.conf.json` incl. `productName`/`bundle.icon`/
> the §0.10 CSP + the three hardening keys + the no-URL-scheme negative (P1.19–P1.24),
> `capabilities/main.json` (P1.21), the §0.8 plugin registration in the Builder
> (single-instance/dialog/store/log/opener, P1.14), the no-updater posture (P1.18),
> and the §0.4.5 tauri-specta codegen pipeline — the `collect_commands!`/`collect_types!`
> registry seam (P1.25), the generated `bindings.ts` (P1.26), the typed-façade
> re-export shells + the single-IPC-consumer lint (P1.27/P1.36), the `cargo xtask
> codegen` invocation + the G19 drift check (P1.28/P1.53). **P2 does NOT re-scaffold
> any of these.** P2 **adds**: the C1–C13 commands + the three `app://` events +
> every wire type into the **existing** `collect_commands!`/`collect_types!` registry
> (P1.25); the behaviour bodies (intake, registries, lifecycle, the startup-ordering
> spine); and the domain/error/detection contract types. Every P2 box that consumes a
> P1 artifact carries an explicit `needs: P1.<n>` so the dependency is `plan-lint`-
> detectable rather than left to document order.
>
> **Behaviour boundaries.** P2 owns *contracts + skeleton*, not engine behaviour: the
> C12 type is declared here, the **probe body is P4**; the §7.2.1 *ordering* is
> established here, the **engine presence/integrity verifier body is P4**; `fs_guard` /
> isolation / pool real bodies are **P3/P4** (P2 declares only the types the contract
> surface references). No engine spawn, no conversion, no corpus.

## Domain model contracts (§0.6 shared vocabulary)

- [x] **P2.1** [RUST] Author the identity types — `InstanceId`/`RunId`/`CollectedSetId`/`ItemId`/`JobId`/`CollectingId` · §0.6 §7.1.2
  needs: P1.9, P1.25
  > the §0.6 identity newtypes (extending the P1.9 identity spine with `JobId`), each deriving `specta::Type` and registered in the P1.25 `collect_types!` registry so they don't generate as `any`.
  > Delivered: the six §0.6 identity types + their `specta::Type` derives + the five-newtype tauri-specta registration already landed in P1.9/P1.15/P1.25 (`JobId` is the §0.6 `type JobId = ItemId` alias — it inherits `ItemId`'s derive + registration, never separately registered); this box adds the one previously-unguarded contract — the compile-time `JobId = ItemId` alias lock (`jobid_compiles_as_itemid_alias`) + scoping the module `dead_code` expectation to `not(test)`.
- [x] **P2.2** [RUST] Author `IntakeOrigin` { Drop, Picker, LaunchArg, SecondInstance } · §0.6 §7.8
  needs: P2.1
- [x] **P2.3** [RUST] Author `UserFacingFormat` (the single grouping key — the full SSOT *What It Converts* set) · §0.6 §1.3
  needs: P2.1
- [x] **P2.4** [RUST] Author `DroppedItem` (`item: ItemId`, raw/resolved path, size, `DetectionOutcome` ref) + the display-only `raw_path` scope note · §0.6 §1.2
  needs: P2.3, P2.15
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.15` points at the `DetectionOutcome` type box later in document order — `DroppedItem.detected: DetectionOutcome` (§0.6 / §1.2-owned) has no type to embed until `DetectionOutcome` (P2.15) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.15 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.15 only `needs: P2.3`), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > `item: ItemId` is the §0.6-invariant-6 freeze-assigned id every eligible `DroppedItem` carries (`ItemId` from P2.1, already `[x]` — no new `needs:` edge); symmetric with `SkippedItem.item` (P2.5). Added by the §0.6 contradiction fix (the 4-field literal had omitted it).
- [x] **P2.5** [RUST] Author `SkippedItem` + `SkipReason` { UnsupportedType, Uncertain, Empty, Unreadable } (id-disjoint over the single id space) · §0.6 §1.3
  needs: P2.4
- [x] **P2.6** [RUST] Author the `CollectedSet` enum — `Single`/`Mixed`/`Unsupported`/`Uncertain`/`Empty` (the C1/C2a return + unified §1.4 confirm-summary fields) + the `CollectedNote` type · §0.6 §1.1 §1.4
  needs: P2.5
  > the §0.6 `CollectedSet` enum + the §1.4-owned **`CollectedNote`** type the §0.6 `CollectedSet` confirm-summary embeds (`notes: Vec<CollectedNote>`, PRODUCED by §1.2's bounded peek — encoding/delimiter/multi-sheet/animation hints): author `CollectedNote` explicitly, deriving `specta::Type` so it mirrors to `bindings.ts` as a NAMED type (never `any`) once consumed — **registration is DEFERRED to the C1 `CollectedSet` consumer (P2.22)** per the established P2.2–P2.5 §0.6 wire-type pattern (the whole CollectedSet graph — `DroppedItem`/`SkippedItem`/`CollectedNote`/… — auto-registers together when C1 is wired; the no-`any` guarantee is the `specta::Type` derive, not an early registration, which would only emit a consumer-less type and churn `bindings.ts` ahead of its command — `[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.6]`). The §1.4 confirm-summary FIELDS are P3.27/P3.28's; the wire TYPE is homed here.
- [x] **P2.7** [RUST] Author the wire-DTO types — `PickKind`/`OpenKind`/`IntakePayload`/`ScanProgress` · §0.6 §0.4.1 §0.4.2
  needs: P2.2
- [x] **P2.8** [RUST] Author the target/option types — `TargetId`/`FormatId`/`CrossCatOp`/`Availability`/`Target`/`TargetOffer`/`OptionValues` · §0.6 §1.5 §1.6
  needs: P2.3
  > the §0.6 target/option vocabulary, decomposed into the scalar/alias layer (P2.8.3) and the composite layer (P2.8.4 — `Target`/`TargetOffer`/`OptionValues` that REFERENCE the scalars + the P2.8.1 `OptionDecl` family + the P2.8.2 `LossyKind`) so the foundational scalars and the composites that depend on them fail independently (_format.md §3.2, dual review once over the combined diff; matching the existing P2.8.1/P2.8.2 sub-box pattern). The §1.5 `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` field (the predictable-loss marker) lives on the P2.8.4 composite `Target` and its `LossyKind` type is authored in the P2.8.2 sub-box so the field type-checks and mirrors to `bindings.ts` rather than generating as `any`.
  - [x] **P2.8.1** [RUST] Author the §1.6 `OptionDecl` wire-type family — `OptionDecl`/`OptionKind`/`OptionKey`/`OptionValue`/`EnumChoice`/`Unit` (+ `LabelKey`) · §0.6 §1.6
    > the §1.6-owned generic option-declaration model the §0.6 `Target.options: Vec<OptionDecl>` embeds and `OptionValues == BTreeMap<OptionKey, OptionValue>` keys on: author `OptionDecl` (the declared knob: key/label/kind/default/tier), `OptionKind` (`IntRange`/`Enum`/`Toggle`/`Size`/`Color`), `OptionKey`, `OptionValue`, `EnumChoice`, `Unit` (and `LabelKey`), each deriving `specta::Type` so they mirror to `bindings.ts` as named types once consumed; **registration is DEFERRED to the C3 `get_targets` consumer (P2.25)** per the P2.2–P2.7 §0.6 defer pattern (`Target.options: Vec<OptionDecl>` auto-registers the family then — the no-`any` guarantee is the `specta::Type` derive, not an early registration; `[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.8]`). This is the **single home** the P4 options-panel RENDERS (P4.64) and P5–P7 register declarations against — without it the entire per-format `OptionDecl` registration design rests on an unhomed type.
  - [x] **P2.8.2** [RUST] Author the §2.9 `LossyKind` enum (all variants) + register it in `collect_types![]` · §2.9 §1.5 §0.4.3 · G23
    needs: P1.25
    > the §2.9 `LossyKind` wire enum the §1.5 `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` field (P2.8.4) and the §0.6 `OutcomeMsg::Lossy { kind }` (P2.20) reference: author every §2.9.1 variant (`image_lossy_codec`/`image_palette`/`image_downscale`/`image_alpha_flatten`/`image_animation_flatten`/`image_svg_raster`/`doc_pdf_reflow`/`doc_pdf_to_text`/`doc_html_render`/`doc_to_text`/`doc_simplified`/`sheet_to_delimited`/`xls_legacy_limits`/`text_encoding_narrowed`/`slides_to_pdf_flatten`/`office_roundtrip_approx`/`pptx_to_ppt_legacy`/`audio_lossy_target`/`audio_transcode`/`audio_lossy_origin`/`audio_bitdepth`/`audio_tags_dropped`/`video_reencode`/`video_alpha_lost`/`video_subs_dropped`/`video_to_gif`/`audio_downmix`), deriving `specta::Type` and **registered in the P1.25 `collect_types![]` registry** (§2.8.2 line 1261 explicitly REQUIRES `LossyKind` derive `specta::Type` + be in `collect_types![]`) so `Target.lossy` does NOT generate as `any` (the no-`any` rule). The enum is the wire TYPE; the §2.9.1 kind→note STRING TABLE is the separate `crate::outcome` box P3.69. **Cardinality note (escalated, not silently reconciled):** §1.5 declares `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` (≤1 on the wire) but §2.9.2 + P4.65 render a CO-APPLYING set (de-dup to the most-specific 2–3) — author the wire field as §1.5 says (`Option<LossyKind>` for the single primary marker) and record the §1.5-vs-§2.9.2 conflict for owner escalation per the conflict order (SSOT > spec); do NOT change `Option` to `Vec` here without a spec decision.
  - [x] **P2.8.3** [RUST] Author the scalar/alias layer — `TargetId`/`FormatId`/`CrossCatOp`/`Availability` (the leaf types the composites key on) · §0.6 §1.5
    needs: P1.25
    > the foundational §0.6 scalar/alias types `TargetId`/`FormatId`/`CrossCatOp`/`Availability` (the leaf vocabulary the P2.8.4 composites reference) — each deriving `specta::Type` so they mirror to `bindings.ts` as named types once consumed; **registration is DEFERRED to the C3 `get_targets` consumer (P2.25)** per the P2.2–P2.7 §0.6 defer pattern (`[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.8]`). Built before the composites (P2.8.4 `needs:` this) so the foundational scalars fail independently of the composite structs that key on them.
  - [x] **P2.8.4** [RUST] Author the composite layer — `Target`/`TargetOffer`/`OptionValues` (referencing the P2.8.3 scalars + P2.8.1 `OptionDecl` + P2.8.2 `LossyKind`) · §0.6 §1.5 §1.6
    needs: P2.8.3, P2.8.1, P2.8.2, P1.25
    > the §0.6 composite types that compose the scalars + the option/lossy families: `Target` (incl. the §1.5 `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` field from P2.8.2 + `options: Vec<OptionDecl>` from P2.8.1), `TargetOffer` (the C3 return — the offered targets + the one pre-highlighted default), `OptionValues == BTreeMap<OptionKey, OptionValue>`; each deriving `specta::Type` so they mirror to `bindings.ts` as named types once consumed; **registration is DEFERRED to the C3 `get_targets` consumer (P2.25)** per the P2.2–P2.7 §0.6 defer pattern (`[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.8]`). Fails independently of the scalar layer (a malformed composite struct vs a missing leaf alias). (`needs: P2.8.3` for the scalars + `P2.8.1`/`P2.8.2` for the `OptionDecl`/`LossyKind` families the composites embed.)
- [x] **P2.9** [RUST] Author the destination/plan types — `DestinationChoice`/`OutputPlan`/`DivertReason` (directory-based, no pre-baked `final_path`) · §0.6 §2.7 §2.14.1
  needs: P2.6
- [x] **P2.10** [RUST] Author `Batch`/`ConversionJob`/`JobState`/`JobStage` · §0.6 §1.9
  needs: P2.8, P2.9, P2.18
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.18` points at the `ErrorKind` type box later in document order — `JobState::Failed(ErrorKind)` (§0.6) has no type to land until `ErrorKind` (P2.18) exists in `crate::outcome`, so DECISION C builds P2.18 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.18 needs only P1.10/P1.25), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Tier-homing (§0.7 ‡, owner-decided option A at P2.10):** `Batch`/`ConversionJob`/`JobState` are authored in `crate::orchestrator` (tier 1), NOT `crate::domain` — they reference `crate::outcome` (`JobState::Failed(ErrorKind)`), so homing them above tier 3 breaks the §0.6 `domain`↔`outcome` cycle (`outcome` is final tier 2, a clean `outcome`→`domain` edge, `domain` stays a pure leaf). `JobStage` (pure event enum, no outcome ref) stays in `crate::domain`.
- [x] **P2.11** [RUST] Author the command-return DTOs — `OutputPlanPreview`/`RerunPrompt`/`RerunDecision`/`PreflightVerdict`/`DestinationResolved` · §0.6 §1.8 §1.10 §2.5
  needs: P2.10, P2.18
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.18` points at the `ErrorKind` type box later in document order — `PreflightVerdict.up_front_fail: Option<ErrorKind>` (§0.6) has no type to land until `ErrorKind` (P2.18) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.18 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Tier-homing (§0.7 ‡, P2.10 principle):** `PreflightVerdict` references `crate::outcome` (`up_front_fail: Option<ErrorKind>`) → authored in `crate::orchestrator` (tier 1), with the C4 `plan_output` contract that assembles it. `OutputPlanPreview` and `DestinationResolved` each embed `preflight: PreflightVerdict`, so they **transitively** reference `crate::outcome` → also `crate::orchestrator` (with the C4/C5 contracts that assemble them); the §0.7 ‡ rule is explicitly "directly **or transitively**", and these command-return DTOs are homed by that rule rather than being separately listed in the §0.7 "lifecycle/result types" enumeration (a distinct §0.6 group — the `Command return DTOs` header). Only the genuinely outcome-free DTOs — `RerunPrompt` (`equivalent_count: usize`) and `RerunDecision` (`{ Skip, FreshCopy }`) — stay in `crate::domain` (the orchestrator-homed previews embed them via a downward `orchestrator`→`domain` edge — allowed).
- [x] **P2.12** [RUST] Author the result types — `RunResult`/`ItemResult`/`Totals`/`CleanupResidue`/`ItemOutcome` · §0.6 §1.12 §2.6
  needs: P2.10, P2.19, P2.20
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.19` points at the `IpcError` shape box later in document order — the `ItemOutcome::Failed { error: IpcError }` variant (§0.6 / §0.4.3) has no payload type to land until `IpcError` (P2.19) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.19 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.20` points at the `OutcomeMsg` box later in document order — `ItemResult.reason: Option<OutcomeMsg>` (§0.6; the documented domain↔outcome type pairing) has nowhere to land until `OutcomeMsg` (P2.20) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.20 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Tier-homing (§0.7 ‡, P2.10 principle):** `RunResult`/`ItemResult`/`ItemOutcome` reference `crate::outcome` (`OutcomeMsg`/`IpcError`) + `JobState` → authored in `crate::orchestrator` (tier 1, which assembles them, §1.12). The pure `Totals`/`CleanupResidue` (counts / §2.6 cleanup info, no outcome ref) may sit in `crate::domain` (leaf) or be co-homed in `orchestrator` with `RunResult` for cohesion — both keep the clean DAG (a downward `orchestrator`→`domain` ref); routine loop choice, not a cycle decision.
- [x] **P2.13** [RUST] Author the engine-descriptor seam types — `EngineId`/`EngineDescriptor`/`EngineKind` (non-trait `FFprobe`/`ImageMagick` note) · §0.6 §3.2
  needs: P2.3
- [x] **P2.14** [TEST] Property-test the §0.6 normative invariants (one-Target-per-Batch, `count == items.len()`, `ConversionJob.item == source.item`, frozen `items`, stable `ItemId`, same-volume publish-temp) · §0.6 · G16
  needs: P2.12, P2.13, P2.128
  > **Gate-ref correction (Co-Pilot):** `G22 G23` → **`G16`** — G16 is the property-test gate (build-gates §6: "Property + fuzz smoke", `proptest`); G22/G23 are the format-membership-parity / `convert_*`-has-a-test **completeness** gates, which do not verify §0.6-invariant property tests (the sibling general-property box P2.126 likewise cites G16, not G22/G23).
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.128` points at the `proptest` dev-dependency box later in document order — P2.14 is the first Rust property test and has no property-test library to use until `proptest` is installed (P2.128), so DECISION C builds P2.128 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.128 `needs:` only the Cargo foundation P1.6), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.

## Detection-outcome contract (the §1.2 result type)

- [x] **P2.15** [RUST] Author `DetectionOutcome` (`Recognized`/`UnsupportedType`/`Uncertain`/`Empty`/`Unreadable`) + `Confidence` { High, Low } + `ReadFailure` { NotFound, PermissionDenied, Locked, IoError } as the single canonical §1.2 detection-result family · §1.2 §0.6
  needs: P2.3
  > `ReadFailure` is folded in here (not its own box) because §1.2 defines `DetectionResult`/`DetectionOutcome`/`Confidence`/`ReadFailure` as one [DECIDED] type-family and `DetectionOutcome::Unreadable { reason: ReadFailure }` embeds it — authoring the family as one box avoids the otherwise-fatal P2.15↔P2.17 needs-cycle.
- [x] **P2.16** [RUST] Author the `DetectionOutcome → SkipReason` projection (ineligible-outcome → skip) · §1.2 §1.3 §0.6
  needs: P2.15, P2.5
- [x] **P2.17** [RUST] Author the `EmptyReport` contract type feeding the `Empty { skipped }` reason tally · §1.2 §0.6
  needs: P2.15
  > the §1.2-cohesive `ReadFailure` is authored with `DetectionOutcome` in P2.15; this box authors only `EmptyReport` (the `Empty { skipped }` tally), which embeds `DetectionResult` — hence `needs: P2.15` is correct and acyclic.

## Error & outcome model contract (the §2.8 wire mirror)

- [x] **P2.18** [RUST] Author `ErrorKind` as a `type` alias of (or drift-locked mirror of) the §2.8 `ConversionErrorKind` in `crate::outcome` · §0.4.3 §2.8.1
  needs: P1.10, P1.25
  - [x] **P2.18.1** [RUST] Enumerate the item-level `ErrorKind` variants byte-identical to the §2.8 catalog · §0.4.3 §2.8.1
  - [x] **P2.18.2** [RUST] Add the run/app-level kinds (`EngineMissing`/`WebviewFault`/`BundleDamaged`) + the mirror-only `MixedDrop` entry · §0.4.3 §2.13.1
  - [x] **P2.18.3** [TEST] Lock anti-drift — `static_assertions` variant-count + variant-name round-trip `#[test]` · §0.4.3 §2.8.2 · G23
- [x] **P2.19** [RUST] Author the `IpcError` shape (`kind`/`message`/`path`/`residue`, derives `specta::Type`, in `collect_types![]`) · §0.4.3 §2.8
  needs: P2.18
- [x] **P2.20** [RUST] Author `OutcomeMsg` + the `SkipReason → ErrorKind` forward (one-way, non-inverted) projection helper · §0.6 §2.8.2 §1.12
  needs: P2.18, P2.5, P2.8.2
  > **needs P2.5 not P2.16 (type-author edge):** P2.20 embeds the `SkipReason` TYPE (`OutcomeMsg::Skipped { reason: SkipReason }` + the `SkipReason → ErrorKind` helper input), authored at P2.5 — NOT the `DetectionOutcome → SkipReason` projection (P2.16), which P2.20 never consumes. (P2.16 is correctly a dependency of P2.67, the mid-walk skip rule that DOES call that projection.) Corrected from a wrong-author-box edge (the type was confused with its projection).

## IPC command surface (C1–C13 contracts)

- [x] **P2.21** [RUST] Wire the `invoke_handler` + register C1–C13 on the Builder (handlers thin, delegate to orchestrator) · §0.4.0 §0.7
  needs: P1.11, P1.13, P1.25, P2.130
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.130` points at the `@tauri-apps/api` dep-add box later in document order — registering C1–C13 makes the generated `bindings.ts` import `@tauri-apps/api/core` (`invoke`), which has no installed package until P2.130, so `tsc --noEmit` (G6/G13) fails (TS2307) until then; DECISION C builds P2.130 first, the edge is acyclic (P2.130 `needs:` only the P1.2.2 lockfile), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
- [x] **P2.22** [RUST] Author the C1 `ingest_paths` contract — frozen-set builder, `origin`, `collectingId`, `drainPending`, non-optional `onScan` Channel · §0.4.1 §1.1 §2.4
  needs: P2.21, P2.6, P2.2, P2.7
- [x] **P2.23** [RUST] Author the C2a `pick_for_intake` contract — Rust-side `DialogExt` picker funnelling into the C1 freeze, no raw path to WebView · §0.4.1 §1.1 §5.4
  needs: P2.22, P1.14, P2.7
- [x] **P2.24** [RUST] Author the C2b `pick_destination` contract — Rust-side folder picker returning the chosen `PathBuf` (the one write-path that transits the WebView) · §0.4.1 §0.10
  needs: P2.21, P1.14
- [x] **P2.25** [RUST] Author the C3 `get_targets` contract — pure function of detection → `TargetOffer` (one pre-highlighted default, no spawn) · §0.4.1 §1.5
  needs: P2.21, P2.8
- [x] **P2.26** [RUST] Author the C4 `plan_output` contract — `OutputPlanPreview` (resolved dest, divert preview, §2.5 rerun, §1.10 preflight) · §0.4.1 §1.8 §2.5 §1.10
  needs: P2.21, P2.11
- [x] **P2.27** [RUST] Author the C5 `set_destination` contract — `DestinationResolved` (re-eval preflight, carry rerun through unchanged) · §0.4.1 §1.8 §2.14.4
  needs: P2.26
- [x] **P2.28** [RUST] Encode the C4/C5 asymmetry as an enforced orchestrator lifecycle rule (C4 re-callable; C5 owns destination; C4 never overrides C5) · §0.4.1
  needs: P2.27
- [x] **P2.29** [RUST] Author the C6 `start_conversion` contract — mint `RunId`, enqueue, return immediately, stream over `onProgress` Channel; `destination` authoritative · §0.4.1 §1.9 §7.1.2
  needs: P2.21, P2.11, P2.37
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.37` points at the `ConversionEvent` Channel-enum box later in document order — the C6 `start_conversion` signature's `onProgress: Channel<ConversionEvent>` parameter (§0.4.1) has nowhere to land until `ConversionEvent` (P2.37) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.37 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.37 → P2.12 → P2.10), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
- [x] **P2.30** [RUST] Author the C7 `cancel_run` contract — trip the `RunId` token (keep finished, discard in-progress) · §0.4.1 §0.4.4 §1.7
  needs: P2.29

This §0.4.2-section box re-listed the same type with **no distinct deliverable**: the type = P2.7; the `Channel<ScanProgress>` arg = C1/P2.22 (`intake.rs:73`); the throttled `on_scan` emit is part of the C1 §1.1 walk implementation (P2.62/P2.64), wired end-to-end into the C1 handler at **P3.49** — there is no dedicated emit box (it is NOT P2.69, which authors cooperative ingest cancellation); `collect_types!` registration rides the §0.6 defer-to-consumer pattern (auto when C1 was wired). No invariant sub-box, no `[GATE]`, no distinct §-mandate. Marked `[x]` as **reconciled**, not a fresh build (verified by the P2 duplicate-box audit — P2.38 is the only true dup in P2). `P2.125.1 needs: P2.38` continues to resolve; its streaming-test prerequisites (the `on_scan` emit in the C1 walk impl + the P3.49 end-to-end wiring) are a separate pre-existing edge question, not addressed here.

This box's REMAINING work is therefore the **in-core `cfg(test)` cross-check** (the §0.4.1-command analog of P2.36's Rust golden test): assert the three `events::APP_*` constants are present + correctly valued (lean on the existing `ipc/mod.rs` name-pin test) AND each event's §0.4.2 payload is authored + registered (lean on the existing P2.39 `main.rs` tests — `AppFault`, `IntakePayload`, `()` for close-requested), so no `app://` payload mirrors as `any`. **Do NOT re-invent the source scan** — reference check 28, build only the in-core cross-check, then check this box off.

## Registries & cancellation lifecycle (the orchestrator state)

  needs: P2.35, P2.23, P2.133
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.133` — this ingest-scoped registry indexes a `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` (§0.4.4 / §1.1, the C13 `cancel_ingest` token), so like the P2.42 run-registry it directly names the `tokio-util` type and must build after the dep-add box (P2.133, later in doc order); acyclic. P2.42 (run) + P2.45 (ingest) are the two same-phase token-registry ROOTS carrying the explicit edge; their consumers (P2.69/P2.70/P2.71 via P2.45) reach P2.133 transitively.

No new content — re-recording would violate one-home-per-fact; this `[DOC]` box confirms the record exists and the P2.43 `RunResultStore` (C8 re-serve) embodies it.

(The separate macOS multi-user machine-global `/tmp` single-instance-socket limitation is recorded as §0.11 T13 by P2.51.) Checked off with this transparent reconcile note per the dup-box protocol — box NOT removed/repurposed.

## OS-intake funnel (§7.8.1) — the launch/Open-with state machine

- [x] **P2.54** [RUST] Build the single `forward_launch_intake(app, paths, origin)` funnel (every launch-time path source routes here) · §7.8.1 §1.1
  needs: P2.47, P2.39
  - [x] **P2.54.1** [RUST] Build `parse_path_args(argv, cwd) -> Vec<PathBuf>` — the §7.8.1 `forward_launch_argv` flag/path classifier · §7.8.1 §7.5.3 §1.1
    > the named §7.8.1 helper `forward_launch_argv(app, argv, cwd, origin)` calls (`forward_launch_intake(app, parse_path_args(argv, cwd), origin)`): separate **flag tokens from file-path tokens** — strip the `--verbose`/env-flag launch switches (`--verbose` is a `[DECIDED]` launch flag, §7.5.3, so it MUST NOT become an ingestable path), skip `argv[0]` (the program path), resolve **relative** path args against the launching `cwd`, and handle Win-vs-Linux argv conventions; return `Vec<PathBuf>`. The §1.1 freeze re-validates every returned path (so this is classification, not a trust boundary) — but the flag-vs-path split + cwd-relative resolution are genuinely homed here. Consumed by the argv intake (P2.57) and the single-instance callback (P2.52, which forwards `argv` via `forward_launch_argv`).
- [x] **P2.55** [RUST] Enforce the §7.1.1 PRIMARY refuse-busy gate inside the funnel (mid-run: DROP paths, no emit, no buffer) · §7.8.1 §7.1.1 §2.4
  needs: P2.54, P2.40, P2.58
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion, owner-confirmed build order):** `needs: P2.58` points forward in document order — P2.55 makes `converter_is_busy` resolve the real §1.9 run-state, which OPENS the idle-flow branch through the funnel; were `buffer_pending_intake` still the P2.54 no-op interface shell (P2.58 unbuilt), an idle-and-not-ready launch set would route into it and be silently lost (path loss). Building P2.58 (the real `State<PendingIntake>` buffer) first closes that window, so DECISION C builds P2.58 before P2.55; the edge is acyclic (P2.55 → P2.58 → P2.54). This encodes the owner-confirmed order already recorded at the `buffer_pending_intake` shell in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` (P2.54). Only P2.55 opens idle-flow — P2.56/P2.57 route through the busy-shell Drop, so neither carries this edge.

  needs: P2.70
- [x] **P2.72** [RUST] Assert the §2.4 freeze idle-vs-in-flight gating contract — the freeze creates a new frozen set (`register` supersedes the prior un-run set, never mutate/merge); busy-refuse stays upstream (the §7.1.1 PRIMARY `forward_launch_intake` funnel + the §5.8 UI defence-in-depth), no core-freeze gate · §1.1 §7.1.1 §2.4
  needs: P2.62, P2.55, P2.44
  > **Scope DECISION (P2.72, Co-Pilot 2026-06-30 — Reading B, no core-side freeze gate):** §7.1.1 names exactly two refuse-busy layers — the PRIMARY `forward_launch_intake` funnel (P2.55) + the §5.8 UI defence-in-depth; a third core-side C1-freeze busy gate is **over-build** (and would conflate "busy" with "nothing" — both returning `Empty`). "IDLE → new frozen set" = `CollectedSetRegistry::register` superseding the prior un-run set (P2.44 mechanism); "never mutate/merge" is **structural** (§2.4.3 "a later drop starts a new frozen set, never mutates an in-flight one" + `register` supersedes-not-merges + `ingest` builds a fresh snapshot each call). No SAFETY need either: a C1 freeze while a run is in flight is benign — the running batch already `take`-evicted its set at C6 `start_conversion` (the same event that turns the converter busy), so a new un-run set never touches it.
  > **P2.72 deliverable:** ASSERT this §1.1/§2.4 freeze-gating contract with orchestrator tests (idle freeze → `register`-supersede = a new set; never-merge; a busy launch-intake dropped upstream at the P2.55 funnel, the freeze never reached) + document the freeze-seam gating delegation. The production `ingest → register` wiring (+ `.manage(CollectedSetRegistry)`) belongs to the **P3.49** end-to-end freeze spine (it needs a real `FrozenCollectedSet` from the walk/detect body), **NOT** P2.72. The delegation-doc deliverable MUST reconcile the two Reading-A-flavoured forward-pointers authored before this decision — the freeze-funnel doc-comment in `orchestrator/mod.rs` (the §2.4 gate "wraps it at P2.72", P2.62) + the P8.1.1 note in `docs/plan/P8-ui-ux.md` (the "P2.55/P2.72" core-side refuse-busy phrasing) — to the upstream-delegation wording: refuse-busy is owned by the P2.55 funnel + §5.8, P2.72 asserts the delegation, it does not wrap `ingest`.

  needs: P1.11
  > **Scope DECISION (P2.74, Co-Pilot 2026-06-30, owner-ratified — option A "split IO-vs-pure"):** P2.74 authors only the PURE §2.3.1 `FileIdentity` TYPE (the de-dup key). The `resolve_identity` FUNCTION (canonicalize + per-OS file identity = IO/FFI, needs `dunce`) is wholly P3 — its shell at P3.1.1, its body at P3.6 (which gains `needs: P2.74`, returning this type) — per the plan's explicit "fs_guard is BUILT in P3". No P2 function shell: no honest `Err` value exists, so a tagged-`Err` placeholder is rejected as a borderline quiet-placeholder (CLAUDE §5); the shell-body convention for all 6 fs_guard shells is set at P3.1.1, in context. The de-dup that USES this type is the pure P2.76 fold; the `resolve_identity` CALL that produces the keys is the P3.49 spine.
  > **Systemic flag (Co-Pilot — needs a dedicated reconciliation pass):** P2.74↔P3.6 is one instance of a WIDER P2↔P3 §1.1 OVERLAP — the built `[x]` P2 §1.1 cluster (walk P2.64–P2.69, zero-byte P2.73, de-dup P2.76, all in `crate::orchestrator`) names the **same §1.1 deliverables** as an unbuilt P3 §1.1 cluster (P3.6 / P3.7 / P3.31 / P3.32, under the P3 `crate::fs_guard` section). P2.74↔P3.6 + P2.76↔P3.7 are the clear split this commit / option A handles. For **P3.31↔P2.64–P2.69** (recursive walk) + **P3.32↔P2.73+P2.76** (zero-byte + de-dup) the pass must CLASSIFY each — a true dup (fold into the P2 box) vs a re-home / build-vs-wire split (the walk's module home, `orchestrator` vs `fs_guard`; the P3.49 end-to-end spine is the wiring layer) — do NOT pre-judge. Reconcile before the Loop reaches P3 (≈60 boxes' runway). **RESOLVED (systemic §1.1 pass, Co-Pilot, owner-ratified):** classified — **P3.31 = DUP** of the P2.64-68 walk primitive (checked off `[x]`; §0.7 homes §1.1 in `crate::orchestrator` where P2 built it, NOT fs_guard — §0.7 > the P3 plan-heading, which was corrected); **P3.32 = re-scoped** to the §2.4 freeze-point primitive (home orchestrator; its zero-byte-classification half is the built P2.73 dup, dropped from the title, applied at the freeze); **P3.6/P3.7 = genuine** (the `resolve_identity` IO body + the real-FS de-dup integration, correctly under the fs_guard §2.3 section — NOT dups). The end-to-end walk→detect→de-dup→freeze wiring is P3.49. See P3.31/P3.32's reconcile notes.

It does NOT call `resolve_identity` (that IO call is the P3.49 spine, feeding this fold). **Dup with P3.7** (same deliverable): the pure logic is homed HERE; P3.7 reconciles to the real-FS integration in the systemic P2↔P3 §1.1 pass (see the P2.74 systemic flag).

  needs: P1.16, P2.77
  > **Reconcile (P2.78) — delivered by P1.16 + P1.19, no new code.** "Create the single `main` window at

  > tests (exactly one `main` window + declared default size + not fullscreen + no secondary window + no

  needs: P2.78
  > **Scope DECISION (P2.81, Co-Pilot 2026-06-30, owner-ratified — option A "split lifecycle-vs-cleanup"):** P2.81 builds the buildable lifecycle half — the run-event closure on the built `App`, the `RunEvent::ExitRequested` `prevent_exit` hook, `RunEvent::Exit` → **`flush_logs`**, and the `_ =>` arm (`RunEvent` is `#[non_exhaustive]`; clippy `wildcard_enum_match_arm` does not fire for an external non-exhaustive enum). The `best_effort_scratch_cleanup` call inside the `Exit` arm is DEFERRED to **P3.74**: §7.3.2 mandates it IS the §2.6 `cleanup_run` path (NOT a separate impl), but `crate::run::cleanup_run` does not exist yet (shell P3.1.2 / body P3.22, the §2.6 P3 cluster) AND nothing is created to clean at P2.81 (no run-scratch until a conversion runs, P3/P4; P2.106.2 creates no dir). Per "the §2.6 kernel is BUILT in P3", the cleanup-invocation is a new P3 box (P3.74, `needs: P2.81, P3.22`) — NOT a P2 stub (a placeholder cleanup would violate §7.3.2's "not a separate implementation" + the no-stub rule). The `Exit` arm carries a one-line comment that the cleanup call joins at P3.74.
- [x] **P2.82** [RUST] Route `RunEvent::Opened` through the funnel inside the `App::run` closure (the macOS Open-with hook, §7.8.1 refuse-busy enforced) · §7.3.2 §7.8.1
  needs: P2.81, P2.56
  > the `RunEvent::Opened { urls }` arm MUST carry `#[cfg(any(target_os = "macos", target_os = "ios", target_os = "android"))]` — the variant's own gating (Tauri v2; the variant is absent on Win/Linux, so an unconditional arm would not compile) — and call `handle_opened` (P2.56). The §7.3.2/§7.8.1 spec fact was corrected ahead of this box (the `.run()` registration is unconditional, the Opened ARM is cfg-gated to the variant), so P2.82 only writes the cfg-gated arm.
- [x] **P2.83** [RUST] Establish the quit-while-converting contract — confirm → cancel-in-flight (§1.7) + §2.6 cleanup + exit = same path as in-UI Cancel; idle quits immediately · §7.3.3 §1.7 §2.6
  needs: P2.80, P2.42
  > **§2.6-cleanup latent-deferral flag (Co-Pilot, P2.81 review — Opus):** P2.83's `§2.6 cleanup` leg reaches the SAME P3-built `crate::run::cleanup_run` (shell P3.1.2 / body P3.22) that P2.81 deferred to P3.74 — `cleanup_run` does not exist in P2. When the Loop reaches P2.83, CLASSIFY the leg (do NOT blindly build a P2 cleanup): contract-only (assert the quit path routes to the SAME in-UI-Cancel path — C7 `cancel_run` + §1.7 cancel + the shared §2.6 cleanup — no `cleanup_run` call authored here) vs deferred-invocation (split like P2.81/P3.74). If the latter, add a P3 wiring box `needs: P3.22`. This is the §2.6 wiring(P2)/kernel(P3) split, NOT the §1.1 dup — flagged so it is not a fresh block at build time.
  > **Resolved contract-only (P2.83, `d018f24`):** asserted the §7.3.3 contract-by-construction in a test-only `quit_while_converting` module (idle-quits-immediately = the sole `prevent_close` is busy-gated, P2.79; a busy quit hands off to the §5.2 confirm UI via the `app://close-requested` emit, P2.80; the core lifecycle inlines no `.cancel(`) — NO core cancel/cleanup, NO `cleanup_run` call, and NO new P3 wiring box: every runtime piece is already scheduled (the frontend §5.2 confirm → the shared C7 `cancel_run` [body P3.52] → the window close → the §7.3.2 `RunEvent::Exit` sweep [P3.74]). Both reviewers confirmed the classification vs the P2.72 precedent.
- [x] **P2.84** [DOC] Record the no-persistent-queue / no-resume-across-launches `[DECIDED]` (in-memory queue only; re-drop on next launch) · §7.3.4 §7.4
  > **Reconciled (P2.84):** the no-persistent-queue / no-resume-across-launches `[DECIDED]` is already recorded in its authoritative spec homes — **§7.3.4** (the `[DECIDED]` "In-flight queue on close": the §1.9 pending/running queue lives only in memory for the process lifetime; quitting discards Pending items + cancels the Running one, §7.3.3; on next launch the user re-drops; resumable batches are out of v1, parked with presets) + **§7.4.1** (the "No resumable queue (§7.3.4)" persistence negative, under the `[DECIDED]` "v1 persists only a 3-key cosmetic/diagnostic blob" posture). No new content — re-recording would violate one-home-per-fact; P2.87 records the broader §7.4.1 persistence-negatives set (history / recent-files / presets / window-geometry / resumable-queue) against the same homes.

## Persistence (§7.4) — the 3-key prefs blob

- [x] **P2.85** [RUST] Implement the 3-key `settings.json` prefs blob via `tauri-plugin-store` (`theme`/`lastDestinationMode`/`verboseLog`, defaults) · §7.4.1 §7.4.2

  needs: P2.85
  > **Reconcile note (Co-Pilot 2026-06-30 — the G29 gate half was pulled forward):** the T2c/G29 enforcement is already complete — the `check-sast` `store_load_count` "one call site" gate was refined (comment/string blanking + atomic-`.store(val, Ordering)` false-positive exclusion) as the P2.85-unblocking L(-1) fix (the coarse count wrongly flagged `orchestrator/mod.rs` `self.ready.store(true, Ordering::Release)` as a 2nd store-open), and the `convertia-store-name-not-constant` Semgrep name-rule already exists (green). The CODE-side convention is embodied by P2.85's SINGLE `app.store(&path)` site with `path` from the `SETTINGS_FILE` constant (no string literal). So P2.86 has no new build — when reached, **check it off `[x]` with this reconcile note** (dup with the delivered enforcement), OR, if a residual is wanted, add only a test asserting the single call site + constant name. Do NOT re-refine the gate (done + g24-covered).
  > **Delivered `[x]` (P2.86, reconcile — no new build):** the T2c/G29 enforcement is complete — the `check-sast` `store_load_count` refinement + its `g24-sast` self-test (`cc4b3f5`, L(-1)) and the pre-existing `convertia-store-name-not-constant` Semgrep name-rule; the code convention is P2.85's SINGLE `app.store(&path)` site keyed on the `SETTINGS_FILE` constant (`6fc22c0`). Per the reconcile note, no gate re-refinement (done + g24-covered) and no residual test — the "exactly one call site" invariant is a source-scan the gate owns, not a Rust unit assertion, so a residual would duplicate the gate.
- [x] **P2.87** [DOC] Record the explicit persistence negatives (no history / recent-files / presets / window-geometry / resumable queue) · §7.4.1 §7.3.4
  > **Reconciled `[x]` (P2.87 — no new content, one-home-per-fact):** all five persistence negatives are already recorded in their §7.4.1 `[DECIDED]` home — "No history / no recent-files / no recent-destinations list"; "No remembered per-format settings / presets"; "No window size/position `[REC]`"; "No resumable queue (§7.3.4)" — with the in-flight-queue / no-resume-across-launches negative also in §7.3.4 (the P2.84 home). Re-recording them elsewhere would violate one-home-per-fact; the P2.84 reconcile note itself named P2.87 as recording this broader set "against the same homes". No new content.
- [x] **P2.88** [RUST] Encode the `lastDestinationMode` re-validate-as-writable-at-use-time rule (a hint, never a guarantee; §2.7 fallback applies) · §7.4.1 §2.7
  needs: P2.85
  > **Reconciled `[x]` (P2.88 — rule encoded; enforcement is P3 + P8) [Co-Pilot Option A, owner-ratified]:** the re-validated-HINT rule is encoded via P2.85's distinct `LastDestinationMode` type + (new, `1e51870`) the `Prefs` consumer-map doc clarification in `prefs.rs`. The re-validate-as-writable ENFORCEMENT is **P3** (C4 §1.10 preflight + §2.7.2 `location_status` + §2.7 divert → beside-source fallback); the store read + the `"beside-source"` / `"<path>"` → `DestinationChoice` mapping are **frontend/P8** (05-ui-ux "Persisted `lastDestinationMode`", JS-side, no IPC). No P2 Rust mapping is built — a `From<LastDestinationMode>` for `DestinationChoice` would be dead-forever (C4 receives the `DestinationChoice` already mapped JS-side). The complete 3-key `Prefs` struct stays (Rust opens the store for `verbose_log` / P2.94 regardless); `theme` / `last_destination_mode` are deliberately frontend-consumed.

## Logging & diagnostics (§7.5) — local-only, no telemetry

- [x] **P2.93** [RUST] Implement the redaction stance — NEVER log file contents/bytes/full-paths at default level; structural facts + basename only · §7.5.3 §2.11
  needs: P2.89
  > **Scope-DECISION (Co-Pilot, P2.93 escalation — ref corrected, NOT a new gate):** the trailing `· G29` is **removed**. G29's rule set (unsafe-policy + the project-local SAST rules a–j, **none** of which concerns logging) carries **no** log-redaction rule, and redaction is **not** SAST-enforced anywhere in the design (a Rust-log-sink taint rule is out of G29's design **and** not required for the v1 bar given the property gate below). Deliverable = the redaction **mechanism** (a default-level basename-only path helper + the in-code convention that every future user-path log site routes through it) + its direct unit test — a real primitive, not a doc-only stance (its immediate consumer is P2.94, which `needs:` this box and adds the verbose full-path override; no dead/untested branch). **Enforcement/verification is the separately-scheduled property gate P2.127** ("secret-shaped stem absent from output", the P0.5.9 §7.5 log-redaction home) — this box does NOT stand it up. **prefs (P2.85) logs ConvertIA's OWN config path, not a user file → outside the stance's scope**; the unit test targets the helper directly, never "prefs is redacted". A structural G29 SAST rule forcing every log site through the helper was considered + **declined for v1** — P2.127 proves redaction behaviorally and this box's convention is the structural half; a sound Rust-log-sink taint rule is a possible §8 owner-decidable hardening, not a v1 requirement. Mechanism shape (newtype vs fn) is the Loop's routine call.
- [x] **P2.94** [RUST] Implement the verbose-mode opt-in (full paths + exact engine argv) read-once-at-startup (`verboseLog` + `--verbose`), effective next launch · §7.5.3 §3.5

    > the §7.5.4 "makes §6.5 operable" capture set verbose mode ADDITIONALLY records beyond P2.94's full-paths/engine-argv (the diagnostic surface the §6.5 reliability gate operationally depends on): the **exact spawned argv per engine** (§3.5), **engine `stderr` persisted** (§2.13 captures-and-classifies; here also written to the log), the **resolved scratch/temp paths** (§2.14), **per-item timing**, and the **chosen output-plan decisions incl. per-location divert** (§1.8). The logging plumbing + the redaction-stance interaction are homed here; the actual capture points are wired by their producers as they land (the per-engine argv/stderr in P4 where the §2.12 spawn wrapper lands, the scratch/temp-path + output-plan/divert captures in P3 where `crate::run`/the §1.8 output-plan land) — each producer feeds this verbose-diagnostics sink. The P2.127 log-redaction property gate must prove the §7.5.4 full paths/scratch-paths added here still redact at default level (only verbose surfaces them).

## Update posture (§7.6) — no auto-updater (defense in depth)

- [x] **P2.97** [DOC] Record the no-startup/background version-check assertion (zero network calls at startup) · §7.6.1 §7.2.2
- [x] **P2.98** [RUST] Encode BOTH C11/About data sources — the version-display source (`app.package_info().version` / `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`) AND the `AppInfo.build_id` PRODUCER (§6 CI build id at build time + deterministic dev fallback) · §7.6.2 §7.2.3 · G19
  needs: P2.34, P2.112
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.112` points at the `AppInfo` type box later in document order — the `build_id`/`version` fields this box populates have nowhere to land until `AppInfo` (P2.112) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.112 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > the two data sources that POPULATE the C11 `AppInfo` (P2.112) the §5.9 About screen renders (RELEASE-BLOCKING per SSOT — neither field may silently ship empty): **(a) version** — `app.package_info().version` / `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, the §7.6.2 displayed current version. **(b) the `build_id` PRODUCER** — wire WHERE the §7.2.3 `build_id: String // CI build identifier (§6)` comes from: the §6 (Lane-B/`build-loop`) build-time CI build identifier (the git SHA + the GitHub Actions run-id, injected at build time via a build-script `env!`/`option_env!` over a CI-set var) with a **deterministic dev fallback** (e.g. the short git SHA or a literal `"dev"` marker when the CI var is absent, never an empty string), so a local `tauri dev` build still yields a non-empty `build_id` and a CI build carries the real §6 identifier. The drift-check (G19, §0.4.5) covers the generated-binding side once C11 is type-shared.

This box added the two-rule EXCLUSIVITY negative tests (File rejects a root/source; folder-browse rejects an output file) + the §7.7.3 DISJOINT-sets doc — the P2.72 "a gating box may be a contract-assertion, not a new gate" pattern; both G1 reviewers validated the decomposition as SOUND.
- [x] **P2.103** [RUST] Implement the split-output two-open-folder-targets contract (`common_root` + `Some(divert_root)` both in the membership set) · §7.7.1 §7.7.3
  needs: P2.102, P2.12
  > **Delivered as a contract-assertion (P2↔P3 §7.7 build-vs-wire, Co-Pilot-ratified):** the `divert_root` disjunct of the folder-browse rule landed with the atomic `open_path_member` gate in P2.101 (it could not be split off). This box pinned the split-output two-targets contract — a diverted run admits BOTH `common_root` and `divert_root` (the previously-untested `divert_root` branch, exercised now) — added the §7.7.1 two-open-folder-buttons doc, and completed the P2.102 `Path`-equality doc enumeration. The P2.72 "a gating box may be a contract-assertion" pattern; both G1 reviewers GO, zero findings. With P2.100–P2.103 the C9 §7.7 membership LOGIC is complete + fully covered; only the P3.51 live wire remains.
- [x] **P2.104** [RUST] Implement C10 as a compiled-in canonical URL constant via `OpenerExt::open_url` (no URL-injection surface) · §7.7.2 §7.6.2
  needs: P2.33
  > **Delivered (C10 body):** filled the `open_project_page` handler now — it needs only the `AppHandle` + the compiled-in `PROJECT_PAGE_URL` constant (`https://github.com/Ne-IA/convertia/releases`), NO `RunResultStore` state (unlike C9, whose live wire is P3.51), so it is fully buildable at P2. `app.opener().open_url(PROJECT_PAGE_URL, None)` Rust-side (no `opener:*` grant, §0.10) — `Ok(())` on success, `Err(InternalError)` on an `OpenerExt` failure; the compiled-in constant IS the §7.7.2 no-injection gate (no `url` wire arg). AppHandle-coupled boot-glue (§1.1a; G28 signature-exempt): tested via the compiled-in-URL read-back + a non-blind handler source-scan, the runtime open is §1.6 E2E / §6.6. `bindings.ts` regenerated (arg-less, AppHandle Tauri-injected); the P2.33 `[Test-Change]` note in `ipc/mod.rs` re-anchored to the `system::c10_contract` module. Both G1 reviewers GO (opus caught + fixed a `mod.rs` doc-sync P1).
- [x] **P2.105** [DOC] Record the open-file safety posture (no auto-open, reveal-in-folder is the preferred default, OS default app on explicit click only) · §7.7.3
  > **Delivered:** added the §7.7.3 "Recorded stance (P2.105) `[DECIDED]`" consolidation bullet — no auto-open (explicit "Open file" click only), reveal-in-folder is the preferred/primary affordance, the OS picks the handler (except the C10 browser-for-URL case) — the P2.97/P2.99 pattern; enforced by the §7.7.2/§7.7.3 C9 membership gate (P2.100–103), exercised by the §6.4.6 E2E / §6.6 walkthrough. Both G1 reviewers GO (Sonnet caught + I fixed a `§1.6`→`§6.4.6` E2E mis-citation; opus had missed it).

Boot-stage tests (§1.1a): `startup_spine` signature-coercion + ordering source-scan pins, `window_model` asserts `visible: false`; `App.test.tsx` pins the step-8 Idle landmark + ready-drain. Spec-synced §7.2.1 (the reveal mechanism) + §7.3.1 (the `window_model` enumeration). Both G1 reviewers GO — fixed: opus P2 spec-sync + the §7.2.1 window-surface over-commitment (softened to defer to P2.109), sonnet P3 `present_startup_fault` §2.13.2→§7.5 citation; residual for P2.109: record the decided app://fault→WebView mechanism (Y) in §7.2.1/§2.13.3 + align the code comment (SSOT>spec>code).

Load-bearing enforcers stay G18 cargo-deny bans + the §0.10 CSP + G29 rule (g). No spec change, no new threat class.

Author the typed §5.1-store-shape selector/façade surfacing `EngineHealth.unavailable_targets: Vec<TargetId>` to the FormatPicker layer over the generated `commands.ts`/`bindings.ts` C12 path (P1.27 façade) — the read seam later consumers bind against. It does **NOT** render anything: the visual **disable-with-reason** FormatPicker tiles (the §5.2 surface — `aria-disabled` on the §3.4 patent-gapped/unavailable tiles) are built for real in **P4.70.2**, fed by the P4.45 `EngineHealth` population, exactly as **P5.32 says "P4 owns the wiring; this box consumes it"**. So this box is the type-shared store-shape seam (buildable now with no backing data), not the disable UI (which has nothing to disable until P4).

  needs: P1.27, P2.37, P2.39, P1.31.2
  > the §5.8 async wiring populates the §5.1 store (typed shape homed in P1.31.2): the live-progress map from the `ConversionEvent::ItemProgress` Channel, and the **`pendingVideoReencodeNote`** field from the `RunStarted.willReencode` signal (§0.4.2/§5.8) — the worst-case `video_reencode` ConvertingNote banner P8.20 reads + P4.65 surfaces. P1.31.2 owns the typed field; this box owns the population.

  needs: P2.36, P2.38
  > the WebView-side analogue of the per-engine watchdog (the §0.4 C6 "return immediately, stream" model + the platform 100s-timeout discipline): assert no synchronous C-command can wedge the UI. The two independent assertions target different commands and fail independently, so they are split into separately-faileable sub-boxes; the parent is `[x]` only when both are (_format.md §2). (The per-ENGINE wall-clock/watchdog timeouts are P3.44/P4.12; this is the C-command-surface responsiveness contract.)
  - [ ] **P2.125.1** [TEST,RUST] Assert the C1 scan-path streams `ScanProgress` on a large folder (never blocks until the whole walk finishes) · §1.1 §1.11 · G31
    needs: P2.38
    > a large-folder C1 `ingest_paths` streams `ScanProgress { scanned }` over its `onScan` Channel (P2.38) rather than blocking until the whole walk completes; a test drives a synthetic large-folder C1 and asserts progress events arrive (the UI is never frozen during a deep recursive walk).
  - [ ] **P2.125.2** [TEST,RUST] Assert C3 `get_targets` / C4 `plan_output` (incl. §1.10 preflight) return within a bounded budget · §0.4 §1.11 · G31
    needs: P2.36
    > C3 `get_targets` / C4 `plan_output` (incl. the §1.10 preflight) and a huge-folder C1 ingest return within a bounded budget or yield cooperatively, never a frozen WebView; a test drives a slow-preflight C4 and asserts the call returns bounded.

## P0 activation targets (the cross-cutting security-test homes P0 points into P2)

> Two P0 boxes carry `→ activated in P2` / `→ activated in P3/P4/P9` edges that point

- [ ] **P2.126** [TEST] Instantiate the P0.4.3 serde-boundary fuzz + per-numeric-IPC-arg overflow legs over the now-real C1–C13 commands · §0.4.3 §1.1 · G48 G16
  needs: P2.36, P0.4.3, P2.128
  > **needs: P2.128 (Co-Pilot):** the per-numeric-IPC-arg overflow leg uses `proptest` (the P2.128 dev-dep); P2.128 is later in document order (forward-ref, DECISION-C — built first), acyclic. (Its serde-boundary fuzz leg rides the separate P0.4.3/G48 cargo-fuzz harness, not `proptest`.)
  > the activation target for the P0.4.3 `→ activated in P2 as C1–C13 land` edge: now that C1–C13 exist (P2.21–P2.35, surface-complete at P2.36), instantiate both legs using the P0.4.3 harness layout — **(a)** the cargo-fuzz serde-boundary target over **each** `#[tauri::command]` (malformed `serde_json` at the IPC boundary → a structured `Err`, **never** a panic across the Tauri boundary) and **(b)** the per-numeric-IPC-arg arithmetic-overflow `proptest` (boundary values `u32::MAX`/`i32::MIN`/0/1/2^16-1 → a structured `Err`, the T10 `arithmetic_side_effects`-deny companion). This is the P2 box the P0.4.3 `→ activated in P2` edge points at (`needs: P2.36`; the P0.4.3 harness/contract is `[x]` before the loop). → activates the P0.4.3 serde-boundary + per-numeric-IPC-arg legs.
- [ ] **P2.127** [TEST] Stand up the §7.5 log-redaction property gate — a secret-shaped path stem through the configured logger is absent from output · §7.5 §2.11 · G31 G15
  needs: P2.94, P2.94.1, P0.5.9
  > the activation target for the P0.5.9 §7.5 log-redaction home (this is the **P2 leg** — the §7.5 log-redaction property gate's home, resolved HERE in P2 where the logging infra lands; the P0.5.9 isolation/privilege-drop arm activates in P4, the egress-window/sentinel arms in P9 — those are SEPARATE P0.5.9 homes, NOT this redaction gate): feed a **secret-looking path stem** (a value matching the gitleaks minisign-secret-key / generic-secret shape, plus a full file path) through the **configured `tauri-plugin-log` logger** (P2.89) and assert the §7.5.3 stance across BOTH levels: at the **default** level the secret-shaped stem AND the full path are **absent** from the rotating-file + stderr output (basename only); at **verbose** level (P2.94) the full path is DISCLOSED by design (the deliberate privacy/reproducibility trade, §7.5.3) while the secret-shaped stem stays **absent** (a secret is never logged at any level) — this is the property test that proves the §7.5.3 redaction stance P2.93 delivers as a mechanism. Distinct from the egress-window sentinels (P9.x), which exercise out-of-input reads, not logger redaction. → this is the P0.5.9 log-redaction activation target (`needs: P2.94`, the verbose-mode/logger box; the P0.5.9 home is `[x]` before the loop).
  > **RECONCILED (Co-Pilot L(-1)):** the redaction gate is **G15/G31** — a `cargo test` (the G15 unit+integration mirror) homed in **G31**'s hosted security-assertion set (the G31 row lists "redaction"), exactly parallel to the temp-ownership assertion (P3.71.1 `G31 G15`; the security-concept + test-strategy temp rows `G15/G31`). Reconciled across security-concept + test-strategy (both now `G15/G31`) and this box (`G31 G15`); P0.5.9's aggregate `G31 G42b` names the common G31 host. Earlier the docs diverged (bare `G15` in security-concept/test-strategy vs bare `G31` in the plan) — no longer.
- [x] **P2.128** [RUST] Add the `proptest` Rust property-test dev-dependency (pinned, Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock) · §6.4.2 §0.8 · G18 G18a
  needs: P1.6
  > the Rust mirror of P1.35.1 (`fast-check`) — add `proptest` (the P0.5.2 canonical Rust property-test library; the language split is Rust=`proptest` / TS=`fast-check`, test-strategy §1.3) to the core crate's `[dev-dependencies]` at a §0.8-pinned floor, regenerate + commit `Cargo.lock`. As a **dev-dependency** it is automatically covered by the P1.59 G18 `cargo deny` license/bans/advisories policy (whole-graph) + the G18a lockfile-integrity leg; `proptest`'s deps are standard MIT/Apache, so no `deny.toml` exception is expected (if a transitive crate trips a policy, that exception is the usual owner-acked L(-1) touch — hard-stop + escalate). For §0.8 drift-protection **parity with `fast-check`** (in the JS floor `check-js-supply-chain`) **and the dev-dep `tempfile`** (in the Rust floor `check-supply-chain`), `proptest` JOINS `check-supply-chain`'s `PINNED_FLOORS` — via the paired `[!extern]` L(-1) box **P2.129**, which MUST FOLLOW this box: `_pinned_floor_assertion()` is reconcile-to-present, so a `PINNED_FLOORS` crate absent from `Cargo.lock` fails G18 — the floor row cannot precede the dep (the P1.35.1-dep ↔ P1.60-floor split). This is the dep the P0.5.2 property-test doctrine + the test-strategy §1.3 "Rust = proptest" mapping presuppose; without this box `proptest` is referenced everywhere but installed by no box (the Rust gap the dedicated P1.35.1 closed for TS). Dependency only; the first Rust property test that USES it (P2.14) carries `needs: P2.128`, as does P2.126 (the per-numeric-IPC-arg overflow `proptest`) and any later Rust property test.
- [x] **P2.129** [CI] Add `proptest` to `check-supply-chain`'s §0.8 `PINNED_FLOORS` (`proptest = 1.11.0`, g24-auto-covered like `tempfile`) — the §0.8 drift-floor row, parity with `fast-check` (JS floor) · §6.4.2 §0.8 · G18 G18a

Adds the `PINNED_FLOORS` entry (`proptest = 1.11.0`, the resolved P2.128 lock version). No dedicated g24 leg: the existing `_all_at_floor` + real-lock legs auto-cover it (like `tempfile`), and the below-floor→caught mechanism is already proven crate-agnostically by the `specta`/`walkdir` legs.

Loop-buildable: pure JS, covered by G18a (lockfile-integrity) + G18c (resolution-URL) automatically (no `onlyBuiltDependencies` entry — no build script). For §0.8 drift-floor parity (the JS floor lists `@tauri-apps/cli`/`zustand`/`fast-check`/`vitest-axe`), `@tauri-apps/api` JOINS `check-js-supply-chain`'s `PINNED_FLOORS_JS` via the paired `[!extern]` L(-1) box P2.131, which MUST FOLLOW this box (reconcile-to-present: a floor crate absent from the lock fails G18 — the gate comment Z.66–68 already names `@tauri-apps/api` as a pending row).

Adds the `PINNED_FLOORS_JS` entry (`@tauri-apps/api = 2.11.1`, the resolved P2.130 lock version) + drops `@tauri-apps/api` from the gate's pending-crates comment (Z.66–68). No dedicated g24 leg: the existing real-lock leg auto-covers it, and the below-floor→caught mechanism is already proven by the `@tauri-apps/cli`/`zustand` legs.

## The §3.2 `Platform` leaf — pulled in-phase for the C11 `AppInfo` contract

> `Platform` is a §3.2-owned engine-layer leaf (`pub enum Platform { Win, MacOS, Linux }`, 03-engines §3.2.2) that the engine framework (the `Engine` trait, `select()`) consumes from P4 — but the C11 `AppInfo` contract (§7.2.3, P2.112) embeds it (`AppInfo.platform: Platform`), so this one leaf is authored **in-phase here** to keep the whole C1–C13 surface (and its G23 completeness gate P2.36) inside P2. The remaining §3.2 leaf types (`Direction`/`EngineCapability`/`ProgressModel`/the `SourceFmt`/`TargetFmt` aliases) stay in P4.3. The dependency arrow runs Engine→Platform (the trait *receives* it as a `capabilities(Platform, …)` parameter), so `Platform` has zero dependency on P4.1/P3.4 and is freely authorable now — this corrects the over-broad P4.3 mega-box, it is not a workaround.

- [x] **P2.132** [RUST] Author the `Platform` enum (`Win`/`MacOS`/`Linux`) into `crate::engines/` — the §3.2-owned leaf the C11 `AppInfo` contract embeds (§7.2.3) and, from P4, the `Engine` trait / `select()` consume · §3.2.2 §0.6 · G29
  needs: P1.25
  > adds the `Platform` enum to the **existing** `crate::engines/` module (bootstrapped at P2.13 with the `EngineId`/`EngineKind`/`EngineDescriptor` descriptor-seam types), the single pulled-forward `Platform` leaf; derives `Serialize` + `specta::Type` so it rides into `bindings.ts` transitively via its `AppInfo` embedder (the C11 `get_app_info` contract, P2.34) — no explicit `collect_types!` registration of `Platform` itself. P4.1 adds the `Engine` trait into the same module later. `needs: P1.25` (the §0.4.5 tauri-specta / `collect_types!` seam), the §0.6-leaf-box convention (parity with P2.110/P2.18).

## The `tokio-util` cancellation dependency — pulled in-phase for the P2.42 run registry

> `tokio-util`'s `CancellationToken` (§0.8 row "Cancellation | **tokio-util** | exact", 00-architecture §0.8) is the §0.4.4 / §1.7 cancellation primitive the run registry (P2.42), the §1.7 dispatch envelope (P3.4 / P4.6) and the cooperative-cancel loop (P3.43 / P3.44 / P3.52) all consume — but it is neither a direct dependency nor floored, and no box scheduled it (the P2.42 plan gap). Spec §0.8 mandates it ("exact"), so a hand-rolled `Arc<AtomicBool>` is a forced deviation — **rejected**: it breaks the §1.7 `(JobId, EngineId, Invocation, CancellationToken)` envelope every later consumer types against. It is already resolved transitively in `Cargo.lock` at `0.7.18` (via `tauri`), so this is a **direct-edge promotion** (the `tempfile` / `serde_json` case), not a newly-resolved package. Split into the dep-add (P2.133, Loop) + the §0.8 floor row (P2.134, `[!extern]` L(-1) Co-Pilot) per the dep↔floor discipline (parity with P2.128↔P2.129).

- [x] **P2.133** [RUST] Promote `tokio-util` to a direct dependency (`tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`, `tokio-util = "0.7.18"`, no extra features) in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock` · §0.8 §0.4.4 §1.7 · G18 G18a
  needs: P1.6
  > the §0.4.4 / §1.7 cancellation primitive the `RunId` → `CancellationToken` run registry (P2.42) needs first. Add `tokio-util = "0.7.18"` to the core crate's `[dependencies]` (caret-pin to the lock-resolved `0.7.18`, the normal-lib convention `serde`/`uuid`/`walkdir` use; `=`-exact is reserved for the codegen-coupled specta tools). **No extra features** — `CancellationToken` lives in the always-available `tokio_util::sync` module (tokio-util's default feature set is empty; `codec`/`io`/`net`/`rt`/`time` are NOT needed), keeping the dependency surface minimal. `tokio-util 0.7.18` is ALREADY in `Cargo.lock` transitively (via `tauri`), so this adds a single direct edge + no newly-resolved package (the `tempfile`/`serde_json` direct-edge-promotion case) — regenerate + commit `Cargo.lock`. Auto-covered by the P1.59 G18 `cargo deny` whole-graph policy + the G18a lockfile-integrity leg (tokio-util is MIT, no `deny.toml` exception expected; a transitive trip would be the usual owner-acked L(-1) escalation). The §0.8 drift-FLOOR row is the paired `[!extern]` L(-1) box **P2.134**, which MUST FOLLOW this box. The cross-phase consumers (P3.4 / P3.43 / P3.44 / P3.52 dispatch+cancel, P4.6 `EngineInvocation`) build in later phases, so `tokio-util` is present before them by phase order. The same-phase consumers that DIRECTLY name the `tokio_util` type are the two token-registry roots **P2.42** (run) + **P2.45** (ingest), which both carry the explicit `needs: P2.133` edge; the remaining P2 token users (P2.69/P2.70/P2.71, P2.83) reach P2.133 transitively via those roots.
- [x] **P2.134** [CI] Add `tokio-util` to `check-supply-chain`'s §0.8 `PINNED_FLOORS` (`tokio-util = 0.7.18`, g24-auto-covered like `tempfile`/`proptest`) — the §0.8 drift-floor row · §0.8 §0.4.4 · G18 G18a
  needs: P2.133
  > **[!extern] (L(-1)):** `scripts/check-supply-chain` + `scripts/gate-selftests/**` are L(-1)-caged — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop skips + collects it. **MUST follow P2.133** (`needs: P2.133`): `_pinned_floor_assertion()` is reconcile-to-present — a `PINNED_FLOORS` crate ABSENT from `Cargo.lock` FAILS G18 (the "relied-upon dep vanished" leg), so the floor row cannot precede the dep landing in the lock (the P2.128-dep ↔ P2.129-floor split). Adds the `PINNED_FLOORS` entry (`tokio-util = 0.7.18`, the resolved P2.133 lock version). §0.8 already lists `tokio-util` ("Cancellation | tokio-util | exact", 00-architecture §0.8), so **no §0.8 table edit is needed** — only the floor row + g24 coverage. No dedicated g24 leg: the existing `_all_at_floor` + real-lock legs auto-cover it (like `tempfile`/`proptest`), the below-floor→caught mechanism already proven crate-agnostically by the `specta`/`walkdir` legs.

## The G28 boot-glue diff-coverage exemption — surfaced by the P2.54 launch funnel

> The §7.8.1 `forward_launch_intake` funnel (P2.54) is the first commit to land a
> **concentrated** block of AppHandle-coupled boot-glue (~23 structurally-unreachable
> lines): it tipped the **G28** change-only diff floor to 78.9 % < 80 %. The glue is **not
> untested** — the boot-stage pattern (source-scan signature pins + the §1.6 E2E + §6.6,
> test-strategy §1.1a) covers it; G28 fired "for the wrong reason" by demanding cargo-test
> EXECUTION coverage of code no mock-harness-free crate can execute. **Owner decision A**
> (escalated by the Build-Loop, ruled by the owner): refine G28 to recognise the boot-stage
> pattern — **not** adopt a `tauri::test` mock harness (option B: reverses the documented
> no-mock stance + adds dependency surface), **not** metric-game a vacuous test-only push
> (option C). The §0.6/§7.8.1 funnel code (P2.54) stays the Loop's [RUST] box; this is the
> paired L(-1) gate refinement (the dep↔floor-split discipline, parity with P2.133↔P2.134).

- [x] **P2.135** [GATE] Make the G28 diff-coverage gate boot-glue-aware — exempt changed lines inside `AppHandle`-signature fns from the change-only floor (still counted in G27), surfaced by the P2.54 funnel · §6.7.1 · G28 G27
  needs: P0.4.8
  > **[!extern] (L(-1), owner decision A):** `scripts/check-coverage` + `scripts/gate-selftests/**` + `docs/security/**` + `docs/process/**` are L(-1)-caged — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop hard-stops + escalates (it did — this box resolves that escalation). `needs: P0.4.8` (the `check-coverage` creator). **Mechanism:** `check-coverage` gains `_apphandle_fn_ranges` — on `_strip_rust`'d source (comments/strings/chars blanked so a `format!("{}")` brace / `'{'` char never miscounts; same-length, offset-stable) it finds each fn whose **signature references an `AppHandle` type** (parameter, return or bound) by **paren-counting** to the body `{` (angle brackets ignored, so `-> T` / generics / `AppHandle<R>` never miscount) then brace-matches the body. `_boot_glue_exempt` reads the HEAD tree for the CHANGED product Rust files + `run_diff`/`_diff_counts` drop those lines from the change-only floor. **STRUCTURAL, not a marker** the loop could self-apply; **FAIL-CLOSED** (a `;`-decl / unbalanced body stays COUNTED); **LOGGED every run** (`[G28] boot-glue exempt: N line(s) in M AppHandle fn(s) … {names}` — no silent exemption). The lines **stay counted in the G27 per-domain floor** (convertia-core clears its 70 line floor — the per-domain headroom absorbs them); only the change-only diff gate, which a concentrated boot-glue diff uniquely breaks, exempts them. **Not a floor relaxation** — `diff_floor` stays 80 (`freeze_floors`); this is a G28 **scope** refinement. Pure helpers homed beside the glue (`intake_disposition`/`parse_path_args` — no `AppHandle` in their signatures) are **not** exempt (verified by the real-`main.rs` partition leg). **Doc-sync (same commit):** build-gates G28 row (the `Delivered P2.135` clause) + G27 row leg-count chain (47→68) + test-strategy **§1.1a** (the boot-stage methodology + the exemption rationale). **Self-test:** `g24-coverage.py` +23 legs (47→70) — `_strip_rust` (comment/nested-comment/string/raw-string/char/lifetime/length/newline), `_apphandle_fn_ranges` (AppHandle-fn / pure-fn / comment-mention / generic / no-body / unbalanced / format!-brace / real-`main.rs` partition incl. `fn main` NOT exempt), `_boot_glue_exempt` + `_diff_counts`-with-exempt. No new dir; `check-coverage` already L(-1) (`scripts/check-*`).

## The `.rs` test-fn-reference staleness gate — a recurring boot-glue-conversion class

> Each time a C-command IPC contract handler is converted to AppHandle-coupled boot-glue
> (P2.60 C1 `ingest_paths`, P2.70 C2a `pick_for_intake`, P2.71 C13 `cancel_ingest`), the named
> test-fn breadcrumb in `ipc/mod.rs`'s command-surface block (the
> `…_contract_is_invocable_and_typed` reference) goes stale — the handler's contract test is
> renamed/replaced but the prose reference is not. The doc-graph freshness gate guards `.md`
> cross-resolution only; **no gate covers `.rs` comment-reference staleness.** The recurring sites are
> now **module-anchored** (drift-resistant by construction — the standing convention below), but a
> mechanical gate is the durable guarantee. **Low severity (cosmetic, no security/correctness), low
> priority** — scheduled, not cadence-blocking.
>
> **Standing convention (effective now, gate-independent):** a test-fn reference in a `.rs` comment is
> **module-anchored** (cite the test module / the surface it exercises), **never** name-anchored to a
> single `#[test] fn` — so a rename cannot strand it. The C1/C2a/C13 intake sites (the recurring
> boot-glue-conversion class) already comply (`intake::c1_contract`/`c2a_contract`/`c13_contract` *module*
> cites); the remaining `ipc/mod.rs` command-surface refs (C2b/C3–C11) are still fn-name-anchored
> (`module::fn_name`) — the first migration targets when the gate lands.

- [!extern] **P2.136** [GATE] Add a `.rs` test-fn-reference staleness check — fail when a `…_contract_is_invocable_and_typed`-style test-fn reference in an `ipc/` source comment names a `fn` that does not exist (the `.rs` analogue of the doc-graph `.md` cross-resolution gate) · tooling-only
  > **[!extern] (L(-1), Co-Pilot-built, low-priority):** a new gate script + its planted-positive/negative self-test are L(-1)-caged (`scripts/check-*`, `scripts/gate-selftests/**`) — the Build-Loop NEVER edits the cage, so this is Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack; the loop **skips + collects** it (no box `needs:` it → no hard-stop). Surfaced by the recurring P2.60/P2.70/P2.71 boot-glue-conversion class.
  > **Scope when built:** a gate script scanning `src-tauri/src/ipc/**` (widen to `src-tauri/src/**` if the class recurs elsewhere) for the documented test-fn-reference form, FAIL-CLOSED when a referenced `fn` name is absent; + a new build-gate row (its gate id assigned at build time) + the planted-positive/negative self-test (a renamed fn MUST red it). Until then the module-anchor convention (above) is the interim mitigation.
