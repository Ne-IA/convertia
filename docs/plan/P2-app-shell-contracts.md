# P2 — App Shell & Pipeline Contracts

> **The spine + the contracts (on top of the P1 scaffold).** P2 stands up the
> running-app **behaviour** the P1 shell can't carry — the window/quit lifecycle,
> single-instance + run identity, the §7.8 OS-intake funnel, persistence, logging —
> and the **detect → plan → convert → publish** contracts: the C1–C13 IPC surface,
> the §0.6 domain types, the error model, the §1.1 intake state machine, the §7.2.1
> ordered startup-sequence spine, and the C12 `EngineHealth` contract — **type-shared
> end-to-end Rust↔TS with NO real engine yet**. P3 (walking skeleton) builds the
> first conversion *through* these contracts; P4 builds the runtime engine-health
> probe that *populates* C12.
>
> Spec homes: [00-architecture](../spec/00-architecture.md) (§0.3/§0.4/§0.6/§0.7/
> §0.9/§0.10), [01-conversion-pipeline](../spec/01-conversion-pipeline.md)
> (§1.1 intake state machine, §1.11 IPC-responsiveness), [07-app-shell](../spec/07-app-shell.md)
> (§7.1 instance/run identity + single-instance, §7.2 startup-sequence ordering +
> C12 `EngineHealth`, §7.3 window lifecycle, §7.4 persistence, §7.5 logging,
> §7.6 no-updater, §7.7 shell-out, §7.8 OS-intake funnel + §7.8.2 negatives).
> Index: [plan/README.md](README.md). Box format: [`_format.md`](_format.md).
>
> **This is the v0 base.** The atomic `[ ]` boxes below derive exhaustively from
> the spec homes; a later adversarial review deepens, splits and completes them.
>
> **Boundaries (read against P1).** P1 already **scaffolded everything structural** —
> the workspace `Cargo.toml` + `src-tauri` crate (P1.6), the §0.7 module tree as
> downward-only shells incl. the G9 assertion (P1.11), the React/TS/Vite/Tailwind
> frontend (P1.29–P1.31), `index.html` + the `x-dns-prefetch-control:off` meta
> (P1.23), `strings/ui.ts` (P1.37), `tauri.conf.json` incl. `productName`/`bundle.icon`/
> the §0.10 CSP + the three hardening keys + the no-URL-scheme negative (P1.19–P1.24),
> `capabilities/main.json` (P1.21), the §0.8 plugin registration in the Builder
> (single-instance/dialog/store/log/opener, P1.14), the no-updater posture (P1.18),
> and the §0.4.5 tauri-specta codegen pipeline — the `collect_commands!`/`collect_types!`
> registry seam (P1.25), the generated `bindings.ts` (P1.26), the typed-façade
> re-export shells + the single-IPC-consumer lint (P1.27/P1.36), the `cargo xtask
> codegen` invocation + the G19 drift check (P1.28/P1.53). **P2 does NOT re-scaffold
> any of these.** P2 **adds**: the C1–C13 commands + the three `app://` events +
> every wire type into the **existing** `collect_commands!`/`collect_types!` registry
> (P1.25); the behaviour bodies (intake, registries, lifecycle, the startup-ordering
> spine); and the domain/error/detection contract types. Every P2 box that consumes a
> P1 artifact carries an explicit `needs: P1.<n>` so the dependency is `plan-lint`-
> detectable rather than left to document order.
>
> **Behaviour boundaries.** P2 owns *contracts + skeleton*, not engine behaviour: the
> C12 type is declared here, the **probe body is P4**; the §7.2.1 *ordering* is
> established here, the **engine presence/integrity verifier body is P4**; `fs_guard` /
> isolation / pool real bodies are **P3/P4** (P2 declares only the types the contract
> surface references). No engine spawn, no conversion, no corpus.

## Domain model contracts (§0.6 shared vocabulary)

- [x] **P2.1** [RUST] Author the identity types — `InstanceId`/`RunId`/`CollectedSetId`/`ItemId`/`JobId`/`CollectingId` · §0.6 §7.1.2
  needs: P1.9, P1.25
  > the §0.6 identity newtypes (extending the P1.9 identity spine with `JobId`), each deriving `specta::Type` and registered in the P1.25 `collect_types!` registry so they don't generate as `any`.
  > Delivered: the six §0.6 identity types + their `specta::Type` derives + the five-newtype tauri-specta registration already landed in P1.9/P1.15/P1.25 (`JobId` is the §0.6 `type JobId = ItemId` alias — it inherits `ItemId`'s derive + registration, never separately registered); this box adds the one previously-unguarded contract — the compile-time `JobId = ItemId` alias lock (`jobid_compiles_as_itemid_alias`) + scoping the module `dead_code` expectation to `not(test)`.
- [x] **P2.2** [RUST] Author `IntakeOrigin` { Drop, Picker, LaunchArg, SecondInstance } · §0.6 §7.8
  needs: P2.1
- [x] **P2.3** [RUST] Author `UserFacingFormat` (the single grouping key — the full SSOT *What It Converts* set) · §0.6 §1.3
  needs: P2.1
- [x] **P2.4** [RUST] Author `DroppedItem` (`item: ItemId`, raw/resolved path, size, `DetectionOutcome` ref) + the display-only `raw_path` scope note · §0.6 §1.2
  needs: P2.3, P2.15
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.15` points at the `DetectionOutcome` type box later in document order — `DroppedItem.detected: DetectionOutcome` (§0.6 / §1.2-owned) has no type to embed until `DetectionOutcome` (P2.15) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.15 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.15 only `needs: P2.3`), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > `item: ItemId` is the §0.6-invariant-6 freeze-assigned id every eligible `DroppedItem` carries (`ItemId` from P2.1, already `[x]` — no new `needs:` edge); symmetric with `SkippedItem.item` (P2.5). Added by the §0.6 contradiction fix (the 4-field literal had omitted it).
- [x] **P2.5** [RUST] Author `SkippedItem` + `SkipReason` { UnsupportedType, Uncertain, Empty, Unreadable } (id-disjoint over the single id space) · §0.6 §1.3
  needs: P2.4
- [x] **P2.6** [RUST] Author the `CollectedSet` enum — `Single`/`Mixed`/`Unsupported`/`Uncertain`/`Empty` (the C1/C2a return + unified §1.4 confirm-summary fields) + the `CollectedNote` type · §0.6 §1.1 §1.4
  needs: P2.5
  > the §0.6 `CollectedSet` enum + the §1.4-owned **`CollectedNote`** type the §0.6 `CollectedSet` confirm-summary embeds (`notes: Vec<CollectedNote>`, PRODUCED by §1.2's bounded peek — encoding/delimiter/multi-sheet/animation hints): author `CollectedNote` explicitly, deriving `specta::Type` so it mirrors to `bindings.ts` as a NAMED type (never `any`) once consumed — **registration is DEFERRED to the C1 `CollectedSet` consumer (P2.22)** per the established P2.2–P2.5 §0.6 wire-type pattern (the whole CollectedSet graph — `DroppedItem`/`SkippedItem`/`CollectedNote`/… — auto-registers together when C1 is wired; the no-`any` guarantee is the `specta::Type` derive, not an early registration, which would only emit a consumer-less type and churn `bindings.ts` ahead of its command — `[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.6]`). The §1.4 confirm-summary FIELDS are P3.27/P3.28's; the wire TYPE is homed here.
- [x] **P2.7** [RUST] Author the wire-DTO types — `PickKind`/`OpenKind`/`IntakePayload`/`ScanProgress` · §0.6 §0.4.1 §0.4.2
  needs: P2.2
- [x] **P2.8** [RUST] Author the target/option types — `TargetId`/`FormatId`/`CrossCatOp`/`Availability`/`Target`/`TargetOffer`/`OptionValues` · §0.6 §1.5 §1.6
  needs: P2.3
  > the §0.6 target/option vocabulary, decomposed into the scalar/alias layer (P2.8.3) and the composite layer (P2.8.4 — `Target`/`TargetOffer`/`OptionValues` that REFERENCE the scalars + the P2.8.1 `OptionDecl` family + the P2.8.2 `LossyKind`) so the foundational scalars and the composites that depend on them fail independently (_format.md §3.2, dual review once over the combined diff; matching the existing P2.8.1/P2.8.2 sub-box pattern). The §1.5 `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` field (the predictable-loss marker) lives on the P2.8.4 composite `Target` and its `LossyKind` type is authored in the P2.8.2 sub-box so the field type-checks and mirrors to `bindings.ts` rather than generating as `any`.
  - [x] **P2.8.1** [RUST] Author the §1.6 `OptionDecl` wire-type family — `OptionDecl`/`OptionKind`/`OptionKey`/`OptionValue`/`EnumChoice`/`Unit` (+ `LabelKey`) · §0.6 §1.6
    > the §1.6-owned generic option-declaration model the §0.6 `Target.options: Vec<OptionDecl>` embeds and `OptionValues == BTreeMap<OptionKey, OptionValue>` keys on: author `OptionDecl` (the declared knob: key/label/kind/default/tier), `OptionKind` (`IntRange`/`Enum`/`Toggle`/`Size`/`Color`), `OptionKey`, `OptionValue`, `EnumChoice`, `Unit` (and `LabelKey`), each deriving `specta::Type` so they mirror to `bindings.ts` as named types once consumed; **registration is DEFERRED to the C3 `get_targets` consumer (P2.25)** per the P2.2–P2.7 §0.6 defer pattern (`Target.options: Vec<OptionDecl>` auto-registers the family then — the no-`any` guarantee is the `specta::Type` derive, not an early registration; `[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.8]`). This is the **single home** the P4 options-panel RENDERS (P4.64) and P5–P7 register declarations against — without it the entire per-format `OptionDecl` registration design rests on an unhomed type.
  - [x] **P2.8.2** [RUST] Author the §2.9 `LossyKind` enum (all variants) + register it in `collect_types![]` · §2.9 §1.5 §0.4.3 · G23
    needs: P1.25
    > the §2.9 `LossyKind` wire enum the §1.5 `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` field (P2.8.4) and the §0.6 `OutcomeMsg::Lossy { kind }` (P2.20) reference: author every §2.9.1 variant (`image_lossy_codec`/`image_palette`/`image_downscale`/`image_alpha_flatten`/`image_animation_flatten`/`image_svg_raster`/`doc_pdf_reflow`/`doc_pdf_to_text`/`doc_html_render`/`doc_to_text`/`doc_simplified`/`sheet_to_delimited`/`xls_legacy_limits`/`text_encoding_narrowed`/`slides_to_pdf_flatten`/`office_roundtrip_approx`/`pptx_to_ppt_legacy`/`audio_lossy_target`/`audio_transcode`/`audio_lossy_origin`/`audio_bitdepth`/`audio_tags_dropped`/`video_reencode`/`video_alpha_lost`/`video_subs_dropped`/`video_to_gif`/`audio_downmix`), deriving `specta::Type` and **registered in the P1.25 `collect_types![]` registry** (§2.8.2 line 1261 explicitly REQUIRES `LossyKind` derive `specta::Type` + be in `collect_types![]`) so `Target.lossy` does NOT generate as `any` (the no-`any` rule). The enum is the wire TYPE; the §2.9.1 kind→note STRING TABLE is the separate `crate::outcome` box P3.69. **Cardinality note (escalated, not silently reconciled):** §1.5 declares `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` (≤1 on the wire) but §2.9.2 + P4.65 render a CO-APPLYING set (de-dup to the most-specific 2–3) — author the wire field as §1.5 says (`Option<LossyKind>` for the single primary marker) and record the §1.5-vs-§2.9.2 conflict for owner escalation per the conflict order (SSOT > spec); do NOT change `Option` to `Vec` here without a spec decision.
  - [x] **P2.8.3** [RUST] Author the scalar/alias layer — `TargetId`/`FormatId`/`CrossCatOp`/`Availability` (the leaf types the composites key on) · §0.6 §1.5
    needs: P1.25
    > the foundational §0.6 scalar/alias types `TargetId`/`FormatId`/`CrossCatOp`/`Availability` (the leaf vocabulary the P2.8.4 composites reference) — each deriving `specta::Type` so they mirror to `bindings.ts` as named types once consumed; **registration is DEFERRED to the C3 `get_targets` consumer (P2.25)** per the P2.2–P2.7 §0.6 defer pattern (`[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.8]`). Built before the composites (P2.8.4 `needs:` this) so the foundational scalars fail independently of the composite structs that key on them.
  - [x] **P2.8.4** [RUST] Author the composite layer — `Target`/`TargetOffer`/`OptionValues` (referencing the P2.8.3 scalars + P2.8.1 `OptionDecl` + P2.8.2 `LossyKind`) · §0.6 §1.5 §1.6
    needs: P2.8.3, P2.8.1, P2.8.2, P1.25
    > the §0.6 composite types that compose the scalars + the option/lossy families: `Target` (incl. the §1.5 `Target.lossy: Option<LossyKind>` field from P2.8.2 + `options: Vec<OptionDecl>` from P2.8.1), `TargetOffer` (the C3 return — the offered targets + the one pre-highlighted default), `OptionValues == BTreeMap<OptionKey, OptionValue>`; each deriving `specta::Type` so they mirror to `bindings.ts` as named types once consumed; **registration is DEFERRED to the C3 `get_targets` consumer (P2.25)** per the P2.2–P2.7 §0.6 defer pattern (`[Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.8]`). Fails independently of the scalar layer (a malformed composite struct vs a missing leaf alias). (`needs: P2.8.3` for the scalars + `P2.8.1`/`P2.8.2` for the `OptionDecl`/`LossyKind` families the composites embed.)
- [x] **P2.9** [RUST] Author the destination/plan types — `DestinationChoice`/`OutputPlan`/`DivertReason` (directory-based, no pre-baked `final_path`) · §0.6 §2.7 §2.14.1
  needs: P2.6
- [x] **P2.10** [RUST] Author `Batch`/`ConversionJob`/`JobState`/`JobStage` · §0.6 §1.9
  needs: P2.8, P2.9, P2.18
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.18` points at the `ErrorKind` type box later in document order — `JobState::Failed(ErrorKind)` (§0.6) has no type to land until `ErrorKind` (P2.18) exists in `crate::outcome`, so DECISION C builds P2.18 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.18 needs only P1.10/P1.25), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Tier-homing (§0.7 ‡, owner-decided option A at P2.10):** `Batch`/`ConversionJob`/`JobState` are authored in `crate::orchestrator` (tier 1), NOT `crate::domain` — they reference `crate::outcome` (`JobState::Failed(ErrorKind)`), so homing them above tier 3 breaks the §0.6 `domain`↔`outcome` cycle (`outcome` is final tier 2, a clean `outcome`→`domain` edge, `domain` stays a pure leaf). `JobStage` (pure event enum, no outcome ref) stays in `crate::domain`.
- [ ] **P2.11** [RUST] Author the command-return DTOs — `OutputPlanPreview`/`RerunPrompt`/`RerunDecision`/`PreflightVerdict`/`DestinationResolved` · §0.6 §1.8 §1.10 §2.5
  needs: P2.10, P2.18
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.18` points at the `ErrorKind` type box later in document order — `PreflightVerdict.up_front_fail: Option<ErrorKind>` (§0.6) has no type to land until `ErrorKind` (P2.18) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.18 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Tier-homing (§0.7 ‡, P2.10 principle):** `PreflightVerdict` references `crate::outcome` (`up_front_fail: Option<ErrorKind>`) → authored in `crate::orchestrator` (tier 1), with the C4 `plan_output` contract that assembles it. `OutputPlanPreview` and `DestinationResolved` each embed `preflight: PreflightVerdict`, so they **transitively** reference `crate::outcome` → also `crate::orchestrator` (with the C4/C5 contracts that assemble them); the §0.7 ‡ rule is explicitly "directly **or transitively**", and these command-return DTOs are homed by that rule rather than being separately listed in the §0.7 "lifecycle/result types" enumeration (a distinct §0.6 group — the `Command return DTOs` header). Only the genuinely outcome-free DTOs — `RerunPrompt` (`equivalent_count: usize`) and `RerunDecision` (`{ Skip, FreshCopy }`) — stay in `crate::domain` (the orchestrator-homed previews embed them via a downward `orchestrator`→`domain` edge — allowed).
- [ ] **P2.12** [RUST] Author the result types — `RunResult`/`ItemResult`/`Totals`/`CleanupResidue`/`ItemOutcome` · §0.6 §1.12 §2.6
  needs: P2.10, P2.19, P2.20
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.19` points at the `IpcError` shape box later in document order — the `ItemOutcome::Failed { error: IpcError }` variant (§0.6 / §0.4.3) has no payload type to land until `IpcError` (P2.19) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.19 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.20` points at the `OutcomeMsg` box later in document order — `ItemResult.reason: Option<OutcomeMsg>` (§0.6; the documented domain↔outcome type pairing) has nowhere to land until `OutcomeMsg` (P2.20) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.20 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Tier-homing (§0.7 ‡, P2.10 principle):** `RunResult`/`ItemResult`/`ItemOutcome` reference `crate::outcome` (`OutcomeMsg`/`IpcError`) + `JobState` → authored in `crate::orchestrator` (tier 1, which assembles them, §1.12). The pure `Totals`/`CleanupResidue` (counts / §2.6 cleanup info, no outcome ref) may sit in `crate::domain` (leaf) or be co-homed in `orchestrator` with `RunResult` for cohesion — both keep the clean DAG (a downward `orchestrator`→`domain` ref); routine loop choice, not a cycle decision.
- [ ] **P2.13** [RUST] Author the engine-descriptor seam types — `EngineId`/`EngineDescriptor`/`EngineKind` (non-trait `FFprobe`/`ImageMagick` note) · §0.6 §3.2
  needs: P2.3
- [ ] **P2.14** [TEST] Property-test the §0.6 normative invariants (one-Target-per-Batch, `count == items.len()`, `ConversionJob.item == source.item`, frozen `items`, stable `ItemId`, same-volume publish-temp) · §0.6 · G22 G23
  needs: P2.12, P2.13

## Detection-outcome contract (the §1.2 result type)

- [x] **P2.15** [RUST] Author `DetectionOutcome` (`Recognized`/`UnsupportedType`/`Uncertain`/`Empty`/`Unreadable`) + `Confidence` { High, Low } + `ReadFailure` { NotFound, PermissionDenied, Locked, IoError } as the single canonical §1.2 detection-result family · §1.2 §0.6
  needs: P2.3
  > `ReadFailure` is folded in here (not its own box) because §1.2 defines `DetectionResult`/`DetectionOutcome`/`Confidence`/`ReadFailure` as one [DECIDED] type-family and `DetectionOutcome::Unreadable { reason: ReadFailure }` embeds it — authoring the family as one box avoids the otherwise-fatal P2.15↔P2.17 needs-cycle.
- [ ] **P2.16** [RUST] Author the `DetectionOutcome → SkipReason` projection (ineligible-outcome → skip) · §1.2 §1.3 §0.6
  needs: P2.15, P2.5
- [ ] **P2.17** [RUST] Author the `EmptyReport` contract type feeding the `Empty { skipped }` reason tally · §1.2 §0.6
  needs: P2.15
  > the §1.2-cohesive `ReadFailure` is authored with `DetectionOutcome` in P2.15; this box authors only `EmptyReport` (the `Empty { skipped }` tally), which embeds `DetectionResult` — hence `needs: P2.15` is correct and acyclic.

## Error & outcome model contract (the §2.8 wire mirror)

- [x] **P2.18** [RUST] Author `ErrorKind` as a `type` alias of (or drift-locked mirror of) the §2.8 `ConversionErrorKind` in `crate::outcome` · §0.4.3 §2.8.1

  needs: P2.18
- [ ] **P2.20** [RUST] Author `OutcomeMsg` + the `SkipReason → ErrorKind` forward (one-way, non-inverted) projection helper · §0.6 §2.8.2 §1.12
  needs: P2.18, P2.16, P2.8.2

## IPC command surface (C1–C13 contracts)

- [ ] **P2.21** [RUST] Wire the `invoke_handler` + register C1–C13 on the Builder (handlers thin, delegate to orchestrator) · §0.4.0 §0.7
  needs: P1.11, P1.13, P1.25

  needs: P2.22, P1.14, P2.7
- [ ] **P2.24** [RUST] Author the C2b `pick_destination` contract — Rust-side folder picker returning the chosen `PathBuf` (the one write-path that transits the WebView) · §0.4.1 §0.10
  needs: P2.21, P1.14

  needs: P2.27
- [ ] **P2.29** [RUST] Author the C6 `start_conversion` contract — mint `RunId`, enqueue, return immediately, stream over `onProgress` Channel; `destination` authoritative · §0.4.1 §1.9 §7.1.2
  needs: P2.21, P2.11, P2.37
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.37` points at the `ConversionEvent` Channel-enum box later in document order — the C6 `start_conversion` signature's `onProgress: Channel<ConversionEvent>` parameter (§0.4.1) has nowhere to land until `ConversionEvent` (P2.37) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.37 first; the edge is acyclic and valid (P2.37 → P2.12 → P2.10), the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
- [ ] **P2.30** [RUST] Author the C7 `cancel_run` contract — trip the `RunId` token (keep finished, discard in-progress) · §0.4.1 §0.4.4 §1.7
  needs: P2.29

- [ ] **P2.34** [RUST] Author the C11 `get_app_info` contract — `AppInfo` (version, build id, platform, third-party-notice) · §0.4.1 §7.2.3
  needs: P2.21, P2.112
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P2.112` points at the `AppInfo` type box later in document order — the C11 `get_app_info` contract returns `AppInfo` (§0.4.1 / §7.2.3), which has no definition to compile / type-share against until `AppInfo` (P2.112) exists, so DECISION C builds P2.112 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
- [ ] **P2.35** [RUST] Author the C13 `cancel_ingest` contract — trip the `CollectingId` ingest-scoped token · §0.4.1 §1.1
  needs: P2.22

## IPC event / Channel surface (the three `app://` events + telemetry Channels)

The §1.1 freeze re-validates every returned path (so this is classification, not a trust boundary) — but the flag-vs-path split + cwd-relative resolution are genuinely homed here.

## The C12 `EngineHealth` contract (probe body is P4)

- [ ] **P2.110** [RUST] Author the `EngineStatus` type (`id`/`present`/`integrity_ok`/`runnable: Option<bool>`) · §7.2.3 §0.6
  needs: P2.13, P1.25
- [ ] **P2.111** [RUST] Author the `EngineHealth` type (`engines`/`unavailable_targets`/`all_critical_ok`) — one row per registry-eligible engine · §7.2.3 §0.6
  needs: P2.110, P2.8.3
  - [ ] **P2.111.1** [DOC] Record the non-trait-binary roll-up rule (`FFprobe`→FFmpeg, `ImageMagick`→`ImageCore`; no standalone `EngineStatus` row) · §7.2.3 §0.6
  - [ ] **P2.111.2** [DOC] Record the `NativeCsvTsv` synthesized always-available `EngineStatus` (appended after the loop, never from it) · §7.2.3 §3.5.6
- [ ] **P2.112** [RUST] Author the `AppInfo` type (C11 return) — version/build_id/platform/third_party_notice · §7.2.3 §0.6
  needs: P2.110, P4.3
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C cross-phase inversion):** `needs: P4.3` points at the §3.2 `Platform` enum owner in a later phase (the spec homes `Platform` in §3.2; P4.3 authors `Platform::{Win,MacOS,Linux}`) — `AppInfo.platform: Platform` (§7.2.3) has no type to land until P4.3 exists, so DECISION C builds P4.3 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
- [ ] **P2.113** [RUST] Wire C12 `get_engine_health` to return the cached `EngineHealth` (the cache is populated by the P4 probe; contract type-shared now) · §0.4.1 §7.2.3
  needs: P2.111, P2.21
- [ ] **P2.114** [UI] Author the typed `EngineHealth` → `unavailable_targets` store-selector seam (contract plumbing only; the visual disable-with-reason tiles are P4.70.2) · §7.2.3 §5.1
  needs: P2.113, P1.27
  > **contract seam only, no engine behaviour** (P2 boundary: "no engine spawn, no conversion, no corpus"; the cache C12 reads is empty until the P4 probe populates it, P2.113 note). Author the typed §5.1-store-shape selector/façade surfacing `EngineHealth.unavailable_targets: Vec<TargetId>` to the FormatPicker layer over the generated `commands.ts`/`bindings.ts` C12 path (P1.27 façade) — the read seam later consumers bind against. It does **NOT** render anything: the visual **disable-with-reason** FormatPicker tiles (the §5.2 surface — `aria-disabled` on the §3.4 patent-gapped/unavailable tiles) are built for real in **P4.70.2**, fed by the P4.45 `EngineHealth` population, exactly as **P5.32 says "P4 owns the wiring; this box consumes it"**. So this box is the type-shared store-shape seam (buildable now with no backing data), not the disable UI (which has nothing to disable until P4). (`needs: P2.113` for the C12 return + `P1.27` for the IPC façade the selector reads through.)

## §7.8.2 explicit negatives (DoD gate 20)

- [ ] **P2.115** [DOC] Record the no-file-association / no-default-handler-claim negative (no `.heic`/`.docx` handler registration) · §7.8.2
- [ ] **P2.116** [DOC] Record the no-URL-scheme / no-deep-link negative (no `convertia://`, no deep-link plugin) · §7.8.2
- [ ] **P2.117** [DOC] Record the no-drag-out / no-clipboard-export negative (parked under Future Ideas; WebView cannot originate a real path drag) · §7.8.2
- [ ] **P2.118** [DOC] Record the no-service / no-login-item / no-shell-extension negative (no Explorer/Quick-Action integration) · §7.8.2
- [ ] **P2.119** [GATE] Assert the §7.8.2 negatives structurally (no deep-link block, no URL-scheme registration under `src-tauri/`) — the DoD-gate-20 enforcement · §7.8.2 §0.10 · G47
  needs: P1.24, P2.116

## Shell-level a11y, English-only, UI-async & IPC-responsiveness contracts

- [ ] **P2.120** [UI] Wire the frontend async model to the generated `commands.*` / `ConversionEvent` Channel + the three `app://` listeners (§5.8) — feeding the §5.1 store live-progress map + the `pendingVideoReencodeNote` field · §5.8 §0.4.2 §5.1
  needs: P1.27, P2.37, P2.39, P1.31.2
  > the §5.8 async wiring populates the §5.1 store (typed shape homed in P1.31.2): the live-progress map from the `ConversionEvent::ItemProgress` Channel, and the **`pendingVideoReencodeNote`** field from the `RunStarted.willReencode` signal (§0.4.2/§5.8) — the worst-case `video_reencode` ConvertingNote banner P8.20 reads + P4.65 surfaces. P1.31.2 owns the typed field; this box owns the population.
- [ ] **P2.121** [UI] Wire the native drag-drop affordance (hover/visual only; paths arrive over the native event → C1, never the DOM drop) · §5.4 §0.4.0
  needs: P2.120, P2.22
- [ ] **P2.122** [UI] Establish the app-chrome a11y baseline (ARIA roles/focus order on the shell — the per-push `vitest-axe` target) · §5.5 · G33a
  needs: P2.120
- [ ] **P2.123** [UI] Enforce English-only / string-ownership on the shell (every user-facing literal in `strings/ui.ts`, no i18n-runtime import) · §5.5 · G57
  needs: P1.37, P2.120
- [ ] **P2.124** [UI] Wire the backend-disconnect / mid-run IPC-drop handling to `AppFault` (the §5.8 app-fault surface) · §5.8 §2.13
  needs: P2.120, P2.39
- [ ] **P2.125** [TEST,RUST] Assert the IPC-responsiveness invariant — no synchronous C-command blocks the WebView past a bound (grouping shell) · §0.4 §1.1 §1.11
  needs: P2.36, P2.38
  > the WebView-side analogue of the per-engine watchdog (the §0.4 C6 "return immediately, stream" model + the platform 100s-timeout discipline): assert no synchronous C-command can wedge the UI. The two independent assertions target different commands and fail independently, so they are split into separately-faileable sub-boxes; the parent is `[x]` only when both are (_format.md §2). (The per-ENGINE wall-clock/watchdog timeouts are P3.44/P4.12; this is the C-command-surface responsiveness contract.)
  - [ ] **P2.125.1** [TEST,RUST] Assert the C1 scan-path streams `ScanProgress` on a large folder (never blocks until the whole walk finishes) · §1.1 §1.11 · G31
    needs: P2.38
    > a large-folder C1 `ingest_paths` streams `ScanProgress { scanned }` over its `onScan` Channel (P2.38) rather than blocking until the whole walk completes; a test drives a synthetic large-folder C1 and asserts progress events arrive (the UI is never frozen during a deep recursive walk).
  - [ ] **P2.125.2** [TEST,RUST] Assert C3 `get_targets` / C4 `plan_output` (incl. §1.10 preflight) return within a bounded budget · §0.4 §1.11 · G31
    needs: P2.36
    > C3 `get_targets` / C4 `plan_output` (incl. the §1.10 preflight) and a huge-folder C1 ingest return within a bounded budget or yield cooperatively, never a frozen WebView; a test drives a slow-preflight C4 and asserts the call returns bounded.

## P0 activation targets (the cross-cutting security-test homes P0 points into P2)

> Two P0 boxes carry `→ activated in P2` / `→ activated in P3/P4/P9` edges that point
> into the C1–C13 surface + the logging infra P2 builds: P0.4.3's per-`#[tauri::command]`
> serde-boundary + per-numeric-IPC-arg overflow legs, and P0.5.9's §7.5 log-redaction
> property gate. These boxes are the concrete activation targets those P0 homes resolve
> against — each names the P0 box-id so the cross-ref is plan-lint-detectable (the
> P3.67→P0.5.8 pattern).

- [ ] **P2.126** [TEST] Instantiate the P0.4.3 serde-boundary fuzz + per-numeric-IPC-arg overflow legs over the now-real C1–C13 commands · §0.4.3 §1.1 · G48 G16
  needs: P2.36, P0.4.3
  > the activation target for the P0.4.3 `→ activated in P2 as C1–C13 land` edge: now that C1–C13 exist (P2.21–P2.35, surface-complete at P2.36), instantiate both legs using the P0.4.3 harness layout — **(a)** the cargo-fuzz serde-boundary target over **each** `#[tauri::command]` (malformed `serde_json` at the IPC boundary → a structured `Err`, **never** a panic across the Tauri boundary) and **(b)** the per-numeric-IPC-arg arithmetic-overflow `proptest` (boundary values `u32::MAX`/`i32::MIN`/0/1/2^16-1 → a structured `Err`, the T10 `arithmetic_side_effects`-deny companion). This is the P2 box the P0.4.3 `→ activated in P2` edge points at (`needs: P2.36`; the P0.4.3 harness/contract is `[x]` before the loop). → activates the P0.4.3 serde-boundary + per-numeric-IPC-arg legs.
- [ ] **P2.127** [TEST] Stand up the §7.5 log-redaction property gate — a secret-shaped path stem through the configured logger is absent from output · §7.5 §2.11 · G31
  needs: P2.94, P2.94.1, P0.5.9
  > the activation target for the P0.5.9 §7.5 log-redaction home (this is the **P2 leg** — the §7.5 log-redaction property gate's home, resolved HERE in P2 where the logging infra lands; the P0.5.9 isolation/privilege-drop arm activates in P4, the egress-window/sentinel arms in P9 — those are SEPARATE P0.5.9 homes, NOT this redaction gate): feed a **secret-looking path stem** (a value matching the gitleaks minisign-secret-key / generic-secret shape, plus a full file path) through the **configured `tauri-plugin-log` logger at verbose level** (P2.89/P2.94) and assert the secret + the full path are **absent** from the rotating-file + stderr output (the §7.5.3 redaction stance P2.93 asserts as a STANCE — this is the property test that proves it fires). Distinct from the egress-window sentinels (P9.x), which exercise out-of-input reads, not logger redaction. → this is the P0.5.9 log-redaction activation target (`needs: P2.94`, the verbose-mode/logger box; the P0.5.9 home is `[x]` before the loop).
