# P9 — Hardening (resource budgets · validation · security · corpus)

> **Goal:** ConvertIA meets its **non-functional contracts** and the **deferred
> empirical items** are validated. P9 *exercises* the controls earlier phases built —
> the §2.12 isolation boundary (P4), the per-engine §3.5.x SSRF/LFR argv/build
> controls (P5–P7), the strings module + structural-a11y wiring (P1/P4), the
> guarantees-fs byte-verbatim-stem / path-limit mechanism (P2/P3) — and **introduces
> no new isolation mechanism**. It stands up the **§6.4.6 headed-E2E infrastructure**
> (the scaffolding that produces the validation outputs), runs the **a11y / fidelity /
> egress / fuzz** validations, verifies the **§0.11 threat map**, and calibrates the

## Boundaries (read against P1/P4/P5–P7/P8)

- **P9 ↔ P1/P4:** P1 built `strings/ui.ts` + the TS gate contracts; P4 wired the
  structural-a11y chrome (ARIA roles, roving-tabindex radiogroup, the focus-on-entry
  rules, the `a11y/announcer.ts` live region) + the §2.12 isolation wrapper + the
  per-push jsdom `vitest-axe` leg (G33a). **P9 does not re-author** any of these — it
  builds the **live-WebView** validation harness and runs the validations the
  per-push leg cannot (computed contrast, the full driven flow, the keyboard-path
  equivalence).
- **P9 ↔ P5–P7:** P5–P7 staged each engine + authored its §3.5.x SSRF/LFR argv/build
  controls + per-push adversarial-egress pull-forward leg (P0.7.12 leg (b)). **P9
  builds the full per-OS egress-DENY window + the armed-window canary + the
  release-confirmation G42/G42b leg** (P0.7.12 leg (c)) that runs every engine's
  adversarial corpus inside it — it does not re-decide any argv control.
- **P9 ↔ P8:** P8 owns the full UI experience + visual polish. **P9 validates** the
  a11y/keyboard floor against the built UI; it does not add UI surfaces.
- **Reads, never re-decides:** the §1.10 resource-budget **design** (ceilings,
  1.3× headroom, ~10 s GIF cap — only the *numbers* are corpus-calibrated here), the
  §3.9.2 ≤400 MB artifact budget (the *gate* runs at release in P10; P9 measures the
  trend), and the §2.12.3 privilege-drop **tier model** (`[DECIDED]`; only the
  achieved-tier matrix is filled here).

### Headed-E2E infrastructure (§6.4.6 — the scaffolding that produces the validations)

- [ ] **P9.1** [TEST] Pin WebdriverIO v9 + `@axe-core/webdriverio` + the E2E client deps in the pnpm workspace · §6.4.6 §6.4.6a · G18c G18d
  needs: P8.28
  > add **WebdriverIO v9** (the W3C-WebDriver-only major, aligned with `tauri-driver`'s W3C session model) and **`@axe-core/webdriverio`** to the §0.8 dependency set, pinned in `pnpm-lock.yaml`; the contrast session (P9.16) reuses the same driver session as the flow E2E, so the JS client is mandatory (the Rust `webdriver`/`fantoccini` crate is rejected — `@axe-core/webdriverio` is JS-only, §6.4.6). Honours the P0.3.8 registry-pin + lifecycle-script lockdown (G18c/G18d).
- [ ] **P9.2** [TEST] Install + pin the `tauri-driver` binary (Windows + Linux only) via the gate-tool fetch-and-verify mechanism · §6.4.6 · G24
  needs: P9.1
  > `tauri-driver` exposes a **WebDriver** endpoint over the platform WebView (WebKitGTK Linux, WebView2 Windows); install it through the P0.2.1 pinned fetch-and-verify mechanism (exact version + checksum, its own G24 wrong-checksum self-test) and record the **`tauri-driver` minor against which the default port `4444` holds**. There is **NO macOS WKWebView driver** — macOS uses the degraded smoke leg (P9.7), so `tauri-driver` is Win/Linux only.
- [ ] **P9.3** [TEST] Author `wdio.conf.js` — `tauri:options` capabilities + the `tauri-driver` host/port binding · §6.4.6
  needs: P9.2
  > the WebdriverIO config: session configured with **`tauri:options`** (`application` = the built-app binary path + any `args`) and a `tauri-driver` host/port WebdriverIO connects to (it proxies to `msedgedriver` on Windows, `WebKitWebDriver` on Linux); **no Chrome/Firefox capability block**. The `${DRIVER_PORT:-4444}` default matches the P9.27.3 readiness-probe port so the two can never disagree.
- [ ] **P9.4** [TEST] Wire the Linux `tauri-driver` leg — AppImage extract + dynamic `productName` binary resolution + `squashfs-root` cleanup · §6.4.6
  needs: P9.3
  - [ ] **P9.4.1** [TEST] Extract the AppImage and point `application` at the extracted ELF, not the `.AppImage` · §6.4.6
    > the AppImage is a self-mounting wrapper WebDriver cannot launch as a process target, so CI runs `./ConvertIA.AppImage --appimage-extract` (or `--appimage-extract-and-run`) and points `tauri:options.application` at the extracted binary under `squashfs-root/usr/bin/`.
  - [ ] **P9.4.2** [TEST] Resolve the extracted binary name DYNAMICALLY from `productName` (glob `squashfs-root/usr/bin/*`) · §6.4.6
    > the extracted name matches the **case-sensitive Tauri `productName`** (e.g. `ConvertIA`, not `convertia`), so CI globs `squashfs-root/usr/bin/*` or reads `productName` from `tauri.conf.json` — a hardcoded lowercase name would not exist.
  - [ ] **P9.4.3** [TEST] Run `rm -rf squashfs-root/` after the E2E so the extracted tree never accumulates · §6.4.6
    > mandatory cleanup so the extracted tree does not contaminate the artifact/disk budget or carry across runs.
- [ ] **P9.5** [TEST] Wire the Linux E2E under `Xvfb` (WebKitGTK needs a display) · §6.4.6
  needs: P9.4
  > the headless Linux runner has no X/Wayland display, so the leg runs under **`xvfb-run -a ...`** (or a Wayland headless compositor); without it WebKitGTK never initialises and the E2E silently can't start. (The egress-window composition with `Xvfb` is P9.13 — this box wires the display for the *non*-egress Lane-A/Lane-B flow leg.)
- [ ] **P9.6** [TEST] Wire the Windows `tauri-driver` leg — `msedgedriver` matched to the runner's WebView2/Edge runtime · §6.4.6
  needs: P9.3
  > a mismatched `msedgedriver` fails to attach, so the CI step **resolves the runner's installed WebView2/Edge build and fetches the matching `msedgedriver`** (not a hardcoded version); pin + capabilities block finalised against the pinned `tauri-driver` minor.
- [ ] **P9.7** [TEST] Wire the macOS degraded smoke leg — synthetic-argv conversion + window/output/exit-0 assertions · §6.4.6 §6.4.4
  needs: P9.1
  > `tauri-driver` has no macOS WKWebView driver, so the macOS automated leg **launches the built app, drives a synthetic `argv` conversion of one corpus file through the launch-intake path (§7.8/§1.1), and asserts (a) window/process present, (b) expected output file appears, (c) exit 0** — a scripted launch + presence/output assertion, NOT a WebDriver flow. (`safaridriver` automates Safari itself, not an embedded WKWebView — it does not apply.) The macOS WebView UX flow is covered by the §6.6 human walkthrough (evidence recorded by P9.45).
- [ ] **P9.8** [TEST] Handle the macOS smoke quarantine + TCC constraints (build-output dir, no zip round-trip; temp-dir-only writes) · §6.4.6 §6.4.4
  needs: P9.7
  > run the smoke test on the **build-output `ConvertIA.app` directly** (no archive/re-extract → no `com.apple.quarantine`, no `spctl`/`xattr` bypass needed); IF the pipeline zips/re-unzips first, run `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ConvertIA.app` before launch. **TCC:** prompts cannot be answered headlessly, so the smoke leg writes/reads a **`TMPDIR`/temp dir only** (no Desktop/Documents/Downloads) where no TCC prompt fires; the TCC-prompt exercise moves to the §6.6 human walkthrough (evidence recorded by P9.45).
- [ ] **P9.9** [TEST] Author the driven §5.2 full-flow E2E via the file-picker path (native drop is NOT automatable) · §6.4.6 §5.2
  needs: P9.5, P9.6
  > the Win/Linux WebDriver run exercises the full §5.2 flow per platform: empty → intake → collected/confirm → target+default → destination shown → progress → summary → open-folder. **Native file-drop cannot be synthesised by WebDriver**, so the automated E2E uses the **file-picker path** (C2a `pick_for_intake` via the §5.10 accelerator → the same C1 `drain_intake` completion door the core-side drop funnel feeds, §1.1); the native drop itself is validated in the §6.6 human walkthrough (evidence recorded by P9.45).
- [ ] **P9.10** [TEST] Assert the Idle "all conversion happens locally, on your machine" reassurance line is present in the E2E · §6.4.6 §5.2 §5.7
  needs: P9.9
  > a cheap string-presence check on the empty/Idle step (SSOT *Offline/privacy* surfaced on Idle, §5.2 row 1 / §5.7) so the offline reassurance can't silently drop — the automated half of the DoD core-UX-flow gate.

---

### A11y validation (§6.4.6a / §5.6 / §5.6.1 — live-WebView + keyboard + SR floors)

- [ ] **P9.11** [TEST] Stand up the `@axe-core/webdriverio` contrast session reusing the §6.4.6 driver session (Linux + Windows) · §6.4.6a §5.6 · G33b
  needs: P9.9, P0.7.11
  > the contrast scan runs on the **live WebView** (jsdom cannot compute contrast, so this is NOT the per-push G33a leg) reusing the same `tauri-driver` session as the flow E2E; the macOS contrast gap is acknowledged (no WKWebView driver) and satisfied only by the §6.6 human walkthrough, recorded in `docs/usability-floor.md`. → executes the P0.7.11 WCAG-AA contrast a11y release policy (G33b — `needs: P0.7.11`, the policy home, `[x]` before the loop).
- [ ] **P9.12** [TEST] Run the WCAG 2.1 AA contrast assertion in BOTH Light and Dark themes · §6.4.6a §5.5 §5.6 · G33b
  needs: P9.11
  > axe `color-contrast` — **≥4.5:1 normal text, ≥3:1 large text + UI components/graphical objects** — run in both themes (§5.5); the rendered colours come from the §5.5 design tokens, so this is what makes the §5.6 "WCAG 2.1 AA" claim verifiable. Any violation at the configured impact level fails the build.
- [ ] **P9.13** [TEST] (Optional belt-and-suspenders) computed-`font-size` ≥16px assertion on the live `@axe-core/webdriverio` session · §6.4.6a §5.5 §5.6 · G33b
  needs: P9.11
  > axe does not check font size; the operative text-size gate is the §6.6 human walkthrough (evidence recorded by P9.45), but an optional Lane-B computed-`font-size` assertion (no main-content text element below 16px = `--text-base`, §5.5) may be added on the live session as defence-in-depth — body copy must use `--text-base` or larger, `--text-xs`/`--text-sm` reserved for supplementary labels.
- [ ] **P9.14** [TEST] Validate the §5.6.1(1) mandatory-ARIA-role contract against the live driven tree · §5.6.1 §5.6 · G33b
  needs: P9.9
  > walk the §5.6.1(1) role table on the driven WebView: DropZone `role="button"`; FormatPicker `role="radiogroup"`+`aria-labelledby`; target tile `role="radio"`+`aria-checked` (disabled tile `aria-disabled="true"`, kept in arrow order); ProgressList row `role="progressbar"`+`aria-valuemin/max/now` (LibreOffice indeterminate row `aria-busy="true"`, cleared on terminal); the three focus-trapped dialogs (RerunPrompt/QuitConfirm `role="alertdialog"`, AboutDialog `role="dialog"`+`aria-modal`) each named via `aria-labelledby`→heading; MixedDropRefusal/UnsupportedNotice/AppFault full-screen states with `aria-live="assertive"` headings (no `alertdialog`). A missing/wrong role is a §6.4.6a failure.
- [ ] **P9.15** [TEST] Validate the §5.6.1(2) assertive-announcement-on-entry set on the live driven flow · §5.6.1 §5.6 · G33b
  needs: P9.14, P4.67.1, P4.75
  > assert the states that MUST announce assertively on entry do (Confirm 3, RerunPrompt 6, Summary 8 + first `Failed` row, MixedDropRefusal 9, UnsupportedNotice 10, QuitConfirm 11 — the component BUILT in P4.67.1, AppFault 12) and the polite ones stay polite (Collecting progress, lossy/divert notes, throttled Converting milestones — no per-tick flood); `aria-busy` cleared to `false` + `aria-valuenow` set to 100/last-known on each item's terminal transition (WCAG 4.1.2). (`needs: P4.75` — the `announcer.ts` body + §5.6.1(2) announce-on-state-entry mechanism this box validates, split from P4.70.)
- [ ] **P9.16** [TEST] Validate the §5.6.1(3) per-state SR traversal table — every state has a non-orphaned landing element · §5.6.1 §5.6 §5.10 · G33b
  needs: P9.14
  > drive each of the 12 states and assert focus lands on the named primary element per the §5.6.1(3) table (Idle→DropZone, Collecting→cancel-or-`role="status"`, Confirm→Confirm button, Targets→default-checked radio then Convert-when-shown, RerunPrompt→Skip, Converting→Cancel, Summary→first-Failed/OpenActions/banner, the full-screen states→their landing per §5.6, QuitConfirm→Stay, AppFault→Start Over) — the "a screen-reader path exists" contract is non-orphaned at every state.
- [ ] **P9.17** [TEST] Validate the keyboard-path equivalence — every action operable keyboard-only via the §5.10 map · §5.6 §5.10 · G33b
  needs: P9.9
  > drive the full §5.2 flow keyboard-only through the §5.10 accelerator map (open picker, confirm batch, pick target via radiogroup arrow-roving, open Advanced, change destination, convert, cancel, open folder/file, dismiss a refusal, answer the re-run prompt) — no mouse-only affordance; modal focus-trap + Esc; the state-6 reducer-level suppression of global accelerators (Ctrl/⌘+N/O/Backspace) while RerunPrompt is open.
- [ ] **P9.18** [TEST] Validate disabled (patent-gapped) tiles stay in arrow-roving with `aria-disabled`+reason, never visual-dim-only · §5.6 §5.6.1 · G33b
  needs: P9.14
  > a patent-gapped tile is `role="radio"` `aria-disabled="true"` `tabindex="-1"` — kept in **arrow-key** roving (so a keyboard user can hear the *why* via `aria-describedby`) but out of the **Tab** sequence; never just visual dimming, never removed from arrow navigation (the roving-tabindex single-tab-stop contract intact).

### §2.10 real-world filename / content fidelity validation

- [ ] **P9.19** [TEST] Author the adversarial-filename §6.4.1 unit corpus — emoji / CJK / RTL / spaces / multi-dot / extension-only stems · §2.10.1 §6.4.1 · G15
  > unit tests over `fs_guard::output_name` proving the stem is preserved **byte-for-byte** (no transliteration, ASCII-folding, emoji-stripping): multi-dot (`my.report.final`→`.pdf`), extension-only-looking tokens, same-format re-encode (`photo.jpg`→`photo (1).jpg` never overwriting), and the space-paren `(n)` numbering shape — not `_1`/`-1`/a hash. (Exercises the P3-built `fs_guard::output_name` primitive, **P3.10** — this box only ADDS the adversarial unit corpus over it, no new mechanism; named in prose per the P9 reciprocal-reconciliation convention.)
- [ ] **P9.20** [TEST] Validate path-as-opaque-OsString — no lossy `to_string_lossy()` in any FS *operation* (display-only at the last step) · §2.10.1 · G9 G15
  > assert ConvertIA operates on the original `OsString`/`PathBuf` and only converts to `String` for *display* to the WebView (replacement char shown, original operated on losslessly); covers Windows WTF-8/UTF-16 (emoji/CJK/combining-mark round-trip) and Unix arbitrary-byte paths. Pairs with the G9 invariant grep (P0.3.10) that no operation path drops to lossy. (Validates the P3-built `fs_guard` FS-operation paths — incl. `output_name` (P3.10) / `check_path_limit` (P3.11) — exercising them, not introducing a new mechanism; named in prose per the P9 convention.)
- [ ] **P9.21** [TEST] Validate the macOS NFC-vs-NFD identity invariant — no missed-identity / duplicate from normalization · §2.10.1 §2.3.1 · G15
  > assert the stem is preserved verbatim (no cross-OS re-normalization) and the §2.3 identity check uses inode/file-index, NOT the name string, so an NFC-vs-NFD difference never causes a missed-identity or a duplicate frozen-set entry.
- [ ] **P9.22** [TEST] Validate `PathTooLong` fail-clearly — Windows 260 / 255-component, macOS 255-byte/PATH_MAX, Linux 255/4096 (no truncation) · §2.10.1 §2.2.3 · G15 G48
  > assert appending `(n)` / swapping the extension that would exceed the **component** or **total** limit emits `PathTooLong` (§2.8) — truncation is never the escape hatch — including on the §2.7 divert path (identical guarantee); the Windows `\\?\` extended-length prefix is used for ConvertIA's own syscalls but a user-facing path > 260 still fails clearly. Sits alongside the §6.4.5 bound-firing fixtures and the P0.4.3 `fs_guard` fuzz. (Validates the P3-built `fs_guard::check_path_limit` primitive, **P3.11** — exercising it, not introducing a new mechanism; named in prose per the P9 convention.)
- [ ] **P9.23** [TEST] Validate CJK/RTL body-text fidelity through every document/sheet/slide pair against the bundled font floor · §2.10.2 §6.4.3 · G31 G32
  needs: P9.31
  > assert CJK + RTL (Arabic/Hebrew) body text survives the doc/sheet/slide conversions (§2.10) rendering from the **committed bundled font set alone** (§3.9.3: Liberation + Carlito + Caladea + curated Noto CJK/RTL) — a missing-font regression fails the gate rather than silently degrading to host-font substitution (no tofu); uses the `cjk-body`/`rtl-body` content-floor corpus tags (P0.4.11 / §6.4.5).
- [ ] **P9.24** [TEST] Validate text-encoding detection (BOM→declared→heuristic) + UTF-8 default; mixed/invalid bytes fail-clearly (no mojibake) · §2.10.2 §6.4.3 · G31 G32
  needs: P9.31
  > assert encoding is detected, never assumed from the extension (BOM → declared charset → heuristic UTF-8→Windows-1252/Latin-1→broader); output text defaults to UTF-8 (no BOM unless the target demands); a **mixed/invalid byte sequence** produces `Corrupt`/`EngineError` (§2.8) rather than mojibake — "mangled" output is never acceptable. Uses the `non-ascii-encoding` content-floor corpus (TXT non-UTF-8 + CSV/TSV non-ASCII).
- [ ] **P9.25** [TEST] Validate CSV encoding + delimiter (`,`/`;`/`\t`/pipe) detected-and-preserved, never silently re-delimited/re-encoded · §2.10.2 §6.4.3 · G31 G32
  needs: P9.31
  > assert per spreadsheets.md: semicolon (European decimal-comma), tab, pipe, UTF-8-BOM/UTF-16/Windows-1252 samples come through with delimiter + encoding intact; the leading `=`/`+`/`@` injection cells preserved literally as text (CSV-injection non-execution on the output side, via a real RFC-4180 reader — NOT bare field-count parity).
- [ ] **P9.26** [TEST] Validate audio/video tag fidelity (any script) + the honest `audio_tags_dropped` disclosure where a target can't store tags · §2.10.2 §6.4.3 · G31 G32
  needs: P9.31
  > assert non-Latin/CJK/RTL tag text round-trips through tag models that support UTF-8 (audio.md tag policy); where a target can't store tags, the §2.9 `audio_tags_dropped` note fires (a disclosed loss, not silent mangling). Uses the `non-latin-tags` content-floor corpus.

### Offline-egress observability gate (§2.11.4 / §6.7.3 — the per-OS deny window + observe-the-attempt)

- [ ] **P9.27** [TEST] Build the per-OS egress-deny window harness — observe-the-attempt, fail the release on any outbound attempt · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
  needs: P9.9, P0.7.12
  > → executes the P0.7.12 offline-egress + read-half observability policy (G42 — `needs: P0.7.12`, the policy home, `[x]` before the loop; the full per-OS deny window + release-confirmation leg this builds is the P9 third leg of the P0.7.12 three-leg breakdown).
  - [ ] **P9.27.1** [TEST] Linux: net-namespace egress block with attempt-visibility (`unshare --net` loopback-only + `strace`/eBPF on connect, or `iptables … -j LOG`/`NFLOG`) · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
    > a bare `-j DROP`/`unshare --net` silently swallows the very packet the monitor needs — so pair the block with `strace`/eBPF on `connect()`/`socket()`/`sendto()` (or `iptables -A OUTPUT … -j LOG`/`NFLOG`, or an `ACCEPT`-to-black-hole sink + `tcpdump`) so a blocked-but-**attempted** egress is observable; any observed *attempt* fails the release.
  - [ ] **P9.27.2** [TEST] Linux: preflight `unshare --net true` assertion + clear diagnostic, fail-loud not silent-skip · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
    > `unshare --net` needs unprivileged userns (`kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1` / `user.max_user_namespaces>0`); a preflight assertion fails loud ("net-namespace unavailable — enable unprivileged userns or run with `--cap-add NET_ADMIN`") rather than silently skipping the isolation. If the VPS runner is containerised, use `--network=none` or `--cap-add NET_ADMIN` rather than in-container `unshare` (the §6.1.4 kernel-recording requirement is the cross-ref).
  - [ ] **P9.27.3** [TEST] Linux: compose the net-ns OUTSIDE `Xvfb`+E2E, bring `lo` up inside, readiness-probe + explicit kill (the pinned §6.7.3 form) · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
    needs: P9.5
    > the net-ns wraps the entire `Xvfb`+E2E process; `ip link set lo up` inside it; `xvfb-run -a --server-args="-nolisten tcp"` (Unix-domain X socket survives net-ns isolation, no TCP X socket inside loopback-only ns); a `curl -sf .../status` readiness probe before the WebdriverIO client + an explicit `kill` of the backgrounded driver + propagated exit code; `${DRIVER_PORT:-4444}` shared between launch and probe. Getting the nesting backwards yields no display or a half-isolated silently-passing gate.
  - [ ] **P9.27.4** [TEST] macOS: `pf` outbound-deny profile (`pass log`/`block log`→`pflog0` read by `tcpdump -i pflog0`) + passwordless-sudo runner-image assumption · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
    > a `pf` profile that **logs** matched outbound so the attempt is captured even while blocked; `pfctl` needs `sudo` (GitHub-hosted macOS runners have passwordless sudo, recorded as a §6.1.4 runner-image assumption — degrades to the packet-monitor alone if a future image drops it). macOS runs the synthetic-argv smoke (P9.7), NOT the WebDriver flow; the WebView CSP offline property on macOS is human-walkthrough + static-config only (the acknowledged §6.10 row 5 gap).
  - [ ] **P9.27.5** [TEST] Windows: per-run `New-NetFirewallRule -Program <resolved abs path> … -Action Block` (created+removed) or AppContainer no-network profile + packet-monitor as the load-bearing gate · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
    > a blanket firewall rule is fragile for a portable unsigned exe at a random `TEMP` path, so scope a per-run block rule to the run's actual exe path (created and removed around the test) **or** launch inside an AppContainer with no network capability; a Job Object is NOT a network-deny mechanism (`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT` governs memory/CPU/process/UI, not sockets). The firewall/AppContainer is best-effort enforcement — the **§2.11.4 packet-monitor assertion is the real load-bearing gate** on Windows. Run both.
- [ ] **P9.28** [TEST] Add the REQUIRED DNS-only sub-assertion to the deny window (zero DNS over the engine PID scope) · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
  needs: P9.27
  > `tcpdump -i any port 53` (Linux/macOS) / Windows ETW `Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client` over the engine PID scope: **zero DNS in the deny window**, with an armed-window canary + a resolver-cache flush so the absence is proven, not coincidental.
- [ ] **P9.29** [TEST] Run the benign full-conversion offline assertion — every category produces zero outbound packets (T9a) · §2.11.4 §6.7.3 · G42
  needs: P9.27

### Cross-phase reconciliation (the deferred P9→P4 mechanism `needs:`)

No P9 box `>`-note defers a `needs:` with the P4.77-forbidden phrasing.
  > **Why P9.46 carries explicit `needs:` while the master P4.77 carries NONE (the two reconciliation-gate models, made explicit):** P4.77 runs a PURELY STRUCTURAL audit (the G20 rule fires on the plan TEXT — it does not build or execute code against the boxes it lists, so it requires none of them `[x]` first). P9.46 is different: the P9 boxes it groups EXECUTE Rust assertions that READ runtime artefacts P4 PRODUCES at build/run time (e.g. the P4.18 `privilege-drop-coverage.toml` the tier-APPLIED regression reads, the P4.37 isolation boundary the fault-injection spawns through), so it takes PHYSICAL `needs:` to guarantee those artefacts exist before the gate runs. Both are valid; the distinction is structural-audit (no needs:) vs runtime-artefact-reading gate (physical needs:) — not an inconsistency.

  > **Boundary stop:** P10.1 carries `needs:` on this box — a `[!extern]` prerequisite of a non-extern box is a loop STOP (`_format.md` §2/§6), so the loop hard-stops at the P9→P10 boundary and hands off to the Co-Pilot until the sweep is `[x]`.
