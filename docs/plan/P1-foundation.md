# P1 — Foundation & Scaffolding

> **The walking skeleton's skeleton.** P1 turns a clean checkout into a buildable,
> bootable, gate-covered ConvertIA: the monorepo + pnpm workspace, the Tauri v2
> shell (Rust core + React 19 / TypeScript-strict / Tailwind / Vite WebView), the
> baseline §0.10 capabilities/CSP, the `src/strings/ui.ts` + `a11y/` module shells,
> the §6.8 governance docs + `.github/` templates, and the §6.7.1 Lane-A CI scaffold
> — so an **empty ConvertIA window boots on Windows, macOS and Linux** and every P1
> commit already runs through the loop + the P0 gates.
>
> Derives from [00-architecture](../spec/00-architecture.md) (§0.4 mechanics, §0.7
> tree, §0.8 pins, §0.10 capabilities/CSP), [06-build-test-release](../spec/06-build-test-release.md)
> (§6.1 build matrix, §6.7.1 Lane A, §6.8 governance), [07-app-shell](../spec/07-app-shell.md)

> **This is the v0 base — the atomic `[ ]` boxes below.** A multi-round adversarial

> **P0 activation targets.** Many P0 boxes carry `> → activated in P1`: their

> `tauri.conf.json`/capabilities/`index.html`, the `strings/ui.ts` keys, the
> codegen output, the cross-platform build matrix) are **scaffolded here**. P1
> boxes that stand those targets up name the P0 gate they satisfy in their `Gnn`
> refs so a later reconciliation pass can match P0's `needs:` against real P1
> box-ids. P0 itself is **not** a `needs:` target of any P1 box — P0 is buildable

## Monorepo, pnpm workspace & repo skeleton

The §0.7 physical tree exists as an empty-but-wired monorepo with a pinned
toolchain, so every later box has a home and the P0 lockfile/registry gates have a
target. The workspace + lockfiles come first because every language gate
(`cargo-deny`/`clippy`/`tsc`) and every later module sits inside them.

- [x] **P1.1** [BUILD] Scaffold the §0.7 physical directory tree (`src-tauri/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`) · §0.7
  > the canonical on-disk layout from the §0.7 "Physical tree" block — empty directories + `.gitkeep` placeholders where a tree must exist before its files land; the tree mirrors the logical-module decomposition so a later box drops a file into a pre-existing home.
  > [Build-Session-Entscheidung: P1.1] `src-tauri/capabilities/` is omitted here — `src-tauri/capabilities/**` is L(-1)-caged (`scripts/l-neg1-files.toml`), so the autonomous loop must not create a placeholder there; the directory is owner-authored at P1.21 (which writes the L(-1) `main.json`), keeping all `capabilities/**` touches under owner control. The 18 cage-free §0.7 leaf dirs are scaffolded with `.gitkeep`.
- [x] **P1.2** [BUILD] Author the root `package.json` + the pnpm workspace definition · §0.7 §0.8 · G18d
  needs: P1.1
  > the repo-root `package.json` (name/private/scripts placeholders) + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declaring the repo-root frontend package (`packages: ['.']` — the §0.7 layout: the frontend package lives at the repo root, sourced from `src/`; `src-tauri/` is the Rust side, not an npm package); pins the pnpm package-manager field to the §0.8 `pnpm@10.13.1` class and sets the `onlyBuiltDependencies` posture the P0 G18d lockdown asserts. [Build-Session-Entscheidung: P1.2] the original "`src/`-rooted frontend package" wording was reconciled to §0.7 (spec > plan, owner-confirmed this session): §0.7 homes `package.json`/`tsconfig.json`/`vite.config.ts`/`index.html` at the repo root, not under `src/`.
  - [x] **P1.2.1** [BUILD] Commit the `.npmrc` registry pin + lifecycle-script posture · §0.8 · G18c G18d
    > the committed `.npmrc` pinning the registry (the P0 G18c resolution-URL guard's target) and asserting `enable-pre-post-scripts=false` / no `unsafe-perm`; this is the config the P0.3.8 JS supply-chain skeleton was authored against.
  - [x] **P1.2.2** [BUILD] Generate + commit the initial `pnpm-lock.yaml` · §0.8 · G18a G18c
    > the first resolved lockfile so the P0 G18a `--frozen-lockfile` + `git diff --exit-code` contract and the G18c resolution-URL guard have a real file to act on (activates P0.4.9 / P0.3.8 for the JS half).
  - [x] **P1.2.3** [BUILD] Add `@tauri-apps/cli` (the `tauri dev`/`tauri build` runner) to frontend devDependencies + the `tauri` pnpm scripts · §0.8 · G18a G18c
    needs: P1.2.2
    > add `@tauri-apps/cli` 2.x (matched to the §0.8 `tauri` 2.x pin) to the frontend `package.json` **devDependencies** — the tool that RUNS every `tauri dev` / `tauri build` invocation (P1.58 debug-build, P10.9 release-build, the P9.4/P11.5 AppImage consumers all depend on it existing + reproducible). The §0.8 dependency table (00-architecture.md) now lists `@tauri-apps/cli` under the Tauri v2 entry (escalated this round). Regenerate + commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` so the dep is locked, add the `tauri dev` / `tauri build` pnpm scripts (replacing P1.2's placeholders), and add `@tauri-apps/cli` to the P1.60 JS-tree §0.8 pinned-floor / G18c / G18d assertion set — mirroring exactly how P1.31.1 homes Zustand and P1.60 homes `vitest-axe`/WebdriverIO. Distinct from P0.2.10's digest-pin of the CLI/bundler in the CI IMAGE (release-trust): that hardens the toolchain that touches the minisigned bytes; THIS commits the CLI to the lockfile so `pnpm install` brings it and `tauri build` is invokable + reproducible at all.
- [x] **P1.3** [BUILD] Confirm `rust-toolchain.toml` (P0.2.1) + add the `llvm-tools-preview` component for cargo-llvm-cov coverage · §0.8 · G24
  > `rust-toolchain.toml` is **created + committed in P0.2.1** (the gate-tool pin box) with the exact stable channel + `rustfmt`/`clippy`, validated not-floating by the P0.2.1 `install-gate-tools` toolchain check — so this box does **not** re-create it (the earlier "Commit rust-toolchain.toml" wording was reconciled when P0.2.1 landed the file). Here, the `llvm-tools-preview` component is ADDED to the existing file now (pre-provisioned — a host-side toolchain component, harmless when unused; the P1.54 coverage leg / `cargo-llvm-cov` consume it once the workspace lands — NOT deferred), and the pinned stable channel is confirmed to still match §0.8. [Co-Pilot, owner-acked L(-1) edit — `rust-toolchain.toml` is L(-1)] (The date-pinned nightly for `cargo-fuzz` lives in `scripts/gate-tools.toml` `[toolchain].fuzz_nightly`, P0.2.1-owned; `rust-toolchain.toml` carries only the single stable channel.)
- [x] **P1.4** [BUILD] Author the root `.gitignore` + `.gitattributes` (text/EOL + LFS hooks) · §0.7 · G52 G24a
  > ignore `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, scratch/build outputs; `.gitattributes` normalises EOL (the P0 G52 editorconfig hygiene companion) and reserves the `filter=lfs` attribute lines the P0 G24a corpus-LFS gate (P0.5.4) keys on; `.gitattributes` joins the L(-1) security-critical-file set.
- [x] **P1.5** [DOC] Confirm the root `.editorconfig` (created P0.3.11) covers EOL/charset/final-newline · tooling-only
  > the committed `.editorconfig` the P0 G52 `editorconfig-checker` consumes — created + committed in P0.3.11 (the editorconfig-checker pin box), so this box CONFIRMS it (it exists, is complete, and asserts UTF-8 / LF / final-newline / trailing-whitespace with the `.md` two-trailing-space + binary-asset carve-outs); no edit needed (the earlier "Author" wording predates P0.3.11 landing the file). `.editorconfig` is L(-1) — a content change would be a Co-Pilot edit, but none is required.

## Rust core crate & Cargo workspace

The `src-tauri/` Rust crate(s) compile from a clean checkout with the §0.7 module
decomposition as interface-only shells, so `clippy`/`cargo-deny`/the unsafe-policy
gate have real crates to act on (activating P0.4.1/P0.3.6/P0.3.7/P0.4.2).

- [x] **P1.6** [RUST] Author the Cargo workspace root + the `src-tauri` core member · §0.7 §0.8 · G18a G53
  needs: P1.1
  > the workspace `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace]` members + resolver "2") with the `src-tauri` core crate as the first member; establishes the workspace-member graph the P0 G53 core-crate forbidden-dependency gate (P0.3.7) scopes its bans to, and the closure G18 (P0.3.6) bans the updater/HTTP-client family in.
  - [x] **P1.6.1** [RUST] Reserve the `convertia-imgworker` workspace member as an empty crate · §3.5.5 §0.7 · G53 G29
    > a compile-only stub member (`fn main`) so the workspace graph carries BOTH first-party crates the P0 G29 `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`-on-every-crate-root check + the G53 core-must-not-link-imgworker-libs rule address from P1; the libvips/libheif link work is P4/P5.
  - [x] **P1.6.2** [RUST] Reserve an `xtask` workspace member for codegen/coverage bins · §0.4.5 §6.7.1 · G19
    > the `xtask` crate that hosts the §0.4.5 codegen invocation + the §6.7.1 step-4/4a Rust xtask bins; named so the P0 G19 drift-check (P0.3.9) can point at a concrete `cargo xtask codegen` command rather than passing on a stale file via a wrong invocation.
- [x] **P1.7** [RUST] Generate + commit the initial `Cargo.lock` · §0.8 · G18a G18b
  needs: P1.6
  > the first resolved Rust lockfile so the P0 G18a `--locked`/`git diff --exit-code` contract + the P0.3.6 `cargo vet check`-on-the-initial-`Cargo.lock` exit gate + the `cargo-deny` advisory/license scan have a real lockfile (activates P0.4.9 / the P0.3.6 clean-`cargo vet check` exit for the Rust half).
- [x] **P1.8** [RUST] Apply the unsafe-policy crate attributes — `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` per first-party crate root · §2.12 §3.5.5 · G29
  needs: P1.6, P1.6.1
  > the crate-root `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` on the core AND `convertia-imgworker` + the single allow-listed FFI module placeholder (`#[allow(unsafe_code)]` appears on exactly one module) — the literal source-level target the P0.4.2 unsafe-policy primary SAST gate (G29) was authored against; FFI module is empty in P1 (filled P4/P5).
- [x] **P1.9** [RUST] Stand up the §0.7 tier-3 `domain` module shell + the §0.6 identity newtypes · §0.6 · G29
  needs: P1.6
  > `crate::domain` with the §0.6 identity newtypes (`InstanceId`/`RunId`/`CollectedSetId`/`ItemId`/`CollectingId`) as compile-only `specta::Type`-deriving stubs — the lowest tier (depends on nothing); the full §0.6 type set is a P2 pipeline-contract task, so P1 lands only the identity spine the tree needs to compile.
- [x] **P1.10** [RUST] Stand up the §0.7 tier-2 `outcome` module shell (error-taxonomy home) · §2.8 · G29
  needs: P1.9
  > `crate::outcome` (the renamed-from-`error` §0.7 module) as an interface-only home for the §2.8 taxonomy + the §0.4.3 `IpcError`/`ErrorKind` wire mirror; P1 lands the module + an empty placeholder so the tree compiles and §06's drift mechanism has a home — the full catalog/strings are P2/§02.
- [x] **P1.11** [RUST] Scaffold the 9 §0.7 Rust library module roots (grouping shell) · §0.7 · G29 G9
  needs: P1.6, P1.9
  > the grouping parent for the nine §0.7 logical module roots, each a compile-only `mod` with its canonical path and dependencies pointing strictly downward, so the §0.7 architecture exists as code (not just a tree) and the P0 G9 repo-invariant greps (no `Command::new` outside `crate::isolation`, no `127.0.0.1` outside `#[cfg(test)]`) have their real module boundaries (activates the P0.3.10 invariants (b)/(c)). Each shell can fail to compile independently and is built + checked off on its own (the loop works the sub-boxes top-to-bottom; a broken `orchestrator` shell is unrelated to a broken `ipc` shell), mirroring the P3.1 three-root split. The parent is `[x]` only when all nine sub-boxes are `[x]` (_format.md §2). Downstream boxes that consume one module root `needs:` the specific sub-box (or P1.11 when they need the whole tree).
  - [x] **P1.11.1** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::platform` module-root shell (the OS-abstraction leaf) · §0.7 · G29
    > compile-only `mod platform` with its canonical path, no dependency on any other §0.7 module (the lowest OS-abstraction leaf); the per-OS helpers later boxes fill (no body in P1).
  - [x] **P1.11.2** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::fs_guard` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29 G9
    > compile-only `mod fs_guard` (canonical path) — the §2.0 no-harm-kernel home P3.1.1 fills; downward-only deps; joins the P0 G9 grep scope.
  - [x] **P1.11.3** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::run` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29
    > compile-only `mod run` (canonical path) — the §2.6 scratch/cleanup-lifecycle home P3.1.2 fills; downward-only deps.
  - [x] **P1.11.4** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::detection` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29
    > compile-only `mod detection` (canonical path) — the §1.2 layered-detection home P3.26 fills; downward-only deps.
  - [x] **P1.11.5** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::engines` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29
    > compile-only `mod engines` (canonical path) — the §3.2 engine-registry/`Engine`-trait home P4.1 fills; downward-only deps.
  - [x] **P1.11.6** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::isolation` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29 G9
    > compile-only `mod isolation` (canonical path) — the §2.12 decoder-isolation home P3.2 (shell) / P4.13 (real wrapper) fill; the sole legitimate `Command::new` site (P0 G9 invariant (b) scopes its grep to this module); downward-only deps.
  - [x] **P1.11.7** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::pool` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29
    > compile-only `mod pool` (canonical path) — the §0.9 subprocess-pool home P3.3 (shell) / P4.20 (real pool) fill; downward-only deps.
  - [x] **P1.11.8** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::orchestrator` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29
    > compile-only `mod orchestrator` (canonical path) — the §1.9 batch/job-lifecycle home P3.46 fills; downward-only deps (calls into fs_guard/run/detection/engines/isolation/pool, never up).
  - [x] **P1.11.9** [RUST] Scaffold the `crate::ipc` module-root shell · §0.7 · G29 G9
    > compile-only `mod ipc` (canonical path) — the §0.4 command/event surface home P2.21 fills; downward-only deps; joins the P0 G9 grep scope (no raw `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` outside `#[cfg(test)]`).

## Tauri v2 shell & app boot

The Tauri v2 host builds and shows an empty window on all three OS from a clean
checkout (the P1 goal proper), wiring the §0.8 plugins and the §7.2.1 ordered
startup spine as far as the foundation allows.

- [x] **P1.12** [RUST] Author the `tauri-build` `build.rs` + the §0.4.5 codegen hook seam · §0.4.0 §0.4.5 · G19
  needs: P1.6
  > `src-tauri/build.rs` running `tauri_build::build()` + the optional tauri-specta generation hook seam (the actual `bindings.ts` emission is P1.26); named so the P0 G19 drift framework (P0.3.9) binds to a concrete generated path + command.
- [x] **P1.13** [RUST] Stand up `main.rs` — the Tauri `Builder`, `tokio` runtime, empty `invoke_handler` + `collect_commands!`/`collect_events!` seam · §0.4.0 §0.4.5 §0.8
  needs: P1.11, P1.12
  > the minimal Tauri v2 entrypoint: the multi-thread `tokio` setup Tauri's async commands run on (§0.8), an empty-but-present `invoke_handler` + the `collect_commands![]`/`collect_events![]` macros (no C-commands yet — those are P2) so the codegen surface exists; the §0.10 capability covers the `main` window so a future command is invokable with no per-command entry.
- [x] **P1.14** [RUST] Register the §0.8 Tauri plugins in the Builder (single-instance, dialog, store, log, opener) · §0.8 §0.10
  needs: P1.13
  > `tauri_plugin_single_instance::init` / `tauri_plugin_dialog::init` / `tauri_plugin_store` / `tauri_plugin_log` / `tauri_plugin_opener` registered in the Builder — the crates §1.1/§0.4.1/§7.4/§7.5/§7.7 depend on; their WebView grants are §0.10 (dialog/opener are Rust-side-only, NOT WebView capabilities). Wiring only; the handlers that USE them are P2+.
- [x] **P1.15** [RUST] Stand up the minimal `setup` closure stages the empty window needs (NOT the §7.2.1 ordering) · §7.2.1 §7.2.2
  needs: P1.14
  > the minimal `setup` closure the bootable empty window needs as named-but-mostly-empty stages: single-instance guard (real via the plugin), `InstanceId` + base-path resolution via `app.path()`, and the window-create slot. **P1 does NOT own the §7.2.1 step ORDER** — the §7.2.1 ordered startup-sequence spine (steps 1–8, the engine-presence / exec-permission / scratch-orphan-reclaim / launch-intake / WebView-absent-fault slots) is the **app-shell spine homed in P2's startup-sequence-ordering cluster** per the README P2 scope; P1 lands only the compile-and-boot stages, P2 establishes the ordering, later phases fill the bodies. The §7.2.1 ref is read-only context here (the ordered sequence is P2's box).
  - [x] **P1.15.1** [RUST] Assert §7.2.2 zero-startup-network as a boot invariant test · §7.2.2 §2.11 · G29
    > a unit/property assertion that the boot path opens no socket (the §7.2.2 observable property + the Lane-A compensating guard for the Lane-B-only egress gate, §6.7.1); pairs with the P0 G29 `std::net` allow-list rule (rule (g)) which is initially empty.
- [x] **P1.16** [RUST] Lock the §7.3.1 config-declared main-window model (no programmatic builder) + structural model test · §7.3.1 §0.3.1
  needs: P1.13, P1.20, P1.27
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P1.20` (the §0.10 CSP encode) and `P1.27` (the `commands.ts`/`events.ts` façade) point at later document-order boxes the window must load a CSP-correct, IPC-wired frame against; DECISION C builds them first. Acyclic + valid; documented at the `needs:` line.
  > **Scope (resolved against §7.3.1 + the machine-checked `needs:`):** P1.16 locks the §7.3.1 window **MODEL**, NOT a rendered frame. The `main` window is **config-declared** in `tauri.conf.json` (P1.19), so Tauri **auto-creates + shows it at startup** — P1.16 adds **no programmatic `WebviewWindowBuilder`** (§7.3.1: "Single main window, created by Tauri at startup"). The `[RUST]` deliverable is to resolve the P1.15 stage-6 window-create slot (record the window is config-driven, no builder) + a **structural §7.3.1-model test** — exactly one window labeled `main`, the default size, **no** secondary window, **no** tray (the no-updater posture is P1.18/G47's, not this box's) — at L1/L2 (no display; the highest technically sensible level — the rendered-frame headed E2E is P9). The **loaded React content** arrives with P1.23 (`index.html`) + P1.31 (the React mount), and the **3-OS boot-build proof is P1.58**: the literal P1 "empty ConvertIA window boots" is the *phase* end-state assembled by P1.16 + P1.23 + P1.31 together, **not** P1.16 in isolation (the prior note's "loaded React frame" wording described that phase end-state, which mismatched this box's `needs:` and triggered a scope escalation — now disambiguated). The §0.3.1 WebView-runtime floor (WebView2/WKWebView/WebKitGTK) is relied-on, not bundled.
- [x] **P1.17** [RUST] Implement the §7.2.4 portable-build executable-permission setup (unix `+x` idempotent) · §7.2.4
  needs: P1.14
  > the `ensure_executable` unix helper (`0o111`-bit set idempotently on each launch) from §7.2.4 — load-bearing for the portable macOS/Linux artifact where extracted sidecars may lack `+x`; Windows is a no-op. P1 lands the helper only (no engines to chmod yet — exercised P4); its slot in the §7.2.1 step-4 sequence is wired by the P2 startup-ordering spine.
- [x] **P1.18** [RUST] Assert the §7.6.1 no-updater posture by construction · §7.6.1 §7.6 · G47
  needs: P1.14
  > assert `tauri-plugin-updater` is absent from `Cargo.toml`/the Builder and no `updater`/pubkey/endpoint config exists — "its absence is the implementation" (§7.6.1); the structural form is the P0 G47 lint over `tauri.conf.json` (no `updater` block / no `createUpdaterArtifacts`), so this box names what the G47 target must NOT contain.

---

## Tauri config, capabilities & CSP baseline

`tauri.conf.json` + `capabilities/main.json` + `index.html` exist and match the
§0.10 locked allowlist/CSP object exactly — the literal targets the P0 G47
CSP/capability structural lint (P0.3.2) was authored against, flipping it from
fail-open to fail-closed.

- [x] **P1.19** [BUILD] Author `tauri.conf.json` — bundle identity, window, externalBin/resources slots, minimum-OS floor · §0.3.1 §0.7 §3.3 · G47
  needs: P1.1
  > the base `tauri.conf.json`: app identifier (`dev.ne-ia.convertia`), the §7.3.1 window, empty-but-declared `bundle.externalBin`/`bundle.resources` slots (engines land P4–P7), and the §0.3.1 supported-OS floor knobs (`minimumSystemVersion: "11.0"`, the Windows/Linux floor notes); the file the P0 G47 lint parses.
  - [x] **P1.19.1** [BUILD] Set `productName: "ConvertIA"` + the §7.3.1 main-window title in `tauri.conf.json` (brand/bundle-name config) · §7.3.1 · G47
    > set the case-sensitive `productName: "ConvertIA"` (the case the §6.9.3 rename pass + P9.4.2's `squashfs-root/usr/bin/*` glob + the P11.2 AppImage RC-artifact collection depend on — `ConvertIA`, NOT `convertia`) and the §7.3.1 main-window title; the field is load-bearing for the AppImage binary name + the Linux/macOS bundle name, not a cosmetic. (The FINAL "ConvertIA"/Ne-IA name itself stays an owner-controlled placeholder per §6.9.3; the slot + the v1 working name are set here.) The macOS plist SET-edge SECURITY/floor negatives (`LSMinimumSystemVersion` propagation + `CFBundleDocumentTypes` absent) are the sibling sub-box P1.19.4 — split out because a wrong `productName` is a bundle-name bug while a present `CFBundleDocumentTypes` is a security-posture regression, two orthogonal failure modes (the plan's brand-config-vs-security-negatives discipline, _format.md §3.2).
  - [x] **P1.19.2** [BUILD] Stage a bundled PLACEHOLDER icon set wired into `tauri.conf.json → bundle.icon` · §6.9.3 §0.3.1 · G47
    > stage the Tauri-required icon set (`32x32.png` / `128x128.png` / `128x128@2x.png` / `icon.icns` / `icon.ico` / the Windows `Square*Logo.png` set) as a bundled-local **placeholder** under `src-tauri/icons/` and wire `bundle.icon` to it, so the build produces a real installable artifact from P1 on (Tauri fails the bundle with no icon set). The FINAL Ne-IA art is the §6.9.3-deferred owner deliverable swapped in the P8.23-class scope-(ii) pass (mirrors the P8.2 BrandLogo placeholder pattern); P1 lands only the placeholder slot. The G47 structural lint additionally asserts `bundle.icon` is non-empty + `productName` is set (the file the lint parses).
  - [x] **P1.19.3** [BUILD] Set the initial `version` in `tauri.conf.json`/`Cargo.toml` + record the semver ↔ `v*`-tag ↔ `release_line` relationship · §7.6.2 §6.5.3
    > set the single source of the app version (the `version` field in `tauri.conf.json` / the workspace `Cargo.toml`, surfaced at runtime as `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` / `app.package_info().version`) at an initial `0.x` semver — the value the §7.6.2 About screen displays (P2.98 reads it) and the `AppInfo.version` field. **Plus record the version scheme** (one home, so it cannot drift): the app `version` is **semver**; a release is cut as a signed annotated **`v<version>` git tag** (the `v*`-tag Lane-B trigger, P0.2.5/P0.2.9/P10.1); the **`release_line`** the P10.44/P10.56/P11 staleness gates key on **IS that version/tag** (`release_line` = "the version/tag it validated", §6.5.3). So `version` ↔ `v*`-tag ↔ `release_line` are one identity in three surfaces — set the slot + record the relationship here so no later box re-decides it. (The FINAL public version/name stays an owner call per §6.9.3; the slot + scheme are set now.)
  - [x] **P1.19.4** [BUILD] Assert the macOS plist SET-edge negatives — `minimumSystemVersion → LSMinimumSystemVersion` propagation + `CFBundleDocumentTypes` absent · §0.3.1 §7.8.2 · G47
    > the two macOS `Info.plist` SET-edge facts split from P1.19.1's brand config (they share the single built `Info.plist` artifact so they co-locate, but they fail for SECURITY/floor reasons orthogonal to the productName branding): (1) the §0.3.1 `minimumSystemVersion: "11.0"` (set in P1.19) propagates into the built bundle's **`LSMinimumSystemVersion`** — the real §0.3.1 OS-floor correctness chain (a wrong value is an OS-floor violation, not a name bug); (2) **`CFBundleDocumentTypes` is absent** from the generated `Info.plist` — the macOS leg of the §7.8.2 no-file-association SECURITY negative (a PRESENT block is a posture regression; P1.24 covers the no-URL-scheme leg, this completes the macOS file-association negative). Both are cheap structural assertions in the same G47 `tauri.conf.json`/generated-plist parse, asserting the positive facts at the source (not only at the P10.13 drift edge).

  > the minimal capability set (`core:default`, `log:default`, `store:default`; NO `fs:`, NO `http:`, NO `shell:allow-execute`, NO `opener:*`, NO `dialog:allow-open`) for the `main` window — the literal allowlist the P0 G47 capability leg asserts (fails any `fs:`/`http:`/`shell`/`opener:`/`dialog:` grant).

  needs: P1.19
  > `app.withGlobalTauri` absent/false, `app.security.dangerousDisableAssetCspModification` absent/false/empty, release-profile `devtools` not enabled — the three by-construction T2-widening knobs the P0 G47 lint asserts absent (P0.3.2); P1 lands the conf in the asserted-clean shape.
- [x] **P1.23** [BUILD] Add the `index.html` shell with the `x-dns-prefetch-control:off` meta · §0.10 · G47
  needs: P1.19
  > the WebView entry `index.html` (Vite mount point) carrying the `<meta http-equiv="x-dns-prefetch-control" content="off">` the §0.10 / P0 G47 lint asserts present — closes the DNS-prefetch side channel CSP alone cannot.
- [x] **P1.24** [BUILD] Assert no custom URL scheme / no `deep-link` / no file-association in any bundle manifest · §0.10 §7.8.2 · G47
  needs: P1.19
  > no `plugins.deep-link` block and no custom URL-scheme in any `Info.plist`/`.desktop`/`.reg` under `src-tauri/` — the §7.8.2 explicit-negative posture the P0 G47 lint scans for; P1 lands the bundle config in the no-scheme shape (the §7.8 intake funnel itself is P2).

## Rust↔TS type-sharing & IPC codegen scaffold

The §0.4.5 tauri-specta codegen pipeline emits the single tracked `bindings.ts`
and CI can prove it non-stale — activating the P0 G19 drift framework (P0.3.9) with
a concrete command + path, even though the C-command surface is empty until P2.

- [x] **P1.25** [RUST] Wire the §0.4.5 tauri-specta builder + the `collect_types!` registry seam · §0.4.5 §0.6
  needs: P1.9, P1.13
  > the tauri-specta `Builder` configured with `collect_commands!`/`collect_events!`/`collect_types!` (the §0.6 identity types from P1.9 registered so they don't generate as `any`), emitting to the single tracked path — the codegen engine the §06 drift check guards; empty command set in P1 (C1–C13 are P2).
- [x] **P1.26** [UI] Generate + commit `src/lib/ipc/bindings.ts` at the single §0.7 tracked path · §0.4.5 §0.7 · G19
  needs: P1.25, P1.29
  > **Forward-ref note (DECISION-C ordering inversion):** `needs: P1.29` points at the Vite config defined later in document order — the codegen + commit runs against that build config, so DECISION C builds P1.29 first; the edge is acyclic and valid, the inversion documented at the `needs:` line.
  > run the codegen and commit the generated `src/lib/ipc/bindings.ts` (the frontend's only IPC door) — the concrete file the P0 G19 drift check regenerates + `git diff --exit-code`s; activates G19 (P0.3.9) with a real generated target.
- [x] **P1.27** [UI] Author the `commands.ts`/`events.ts` typed-façade re-export shells · §5.1 §5.8
  needs: P1.26
  > `src/lib/ipc/commands.ts` + `events.ts` re-exporting the generated `bindings.ts` wrappers — the §5.1 hard-rule seam ("only `src/lib/ipc/**` imports `@tauri-apps/api`"); empty re-exports in P1 (feature code that consumes them is P2+), so the one-IPC-consumer discipline is lint-enforceable from the first commit.
- [!extern] **P1.28** [CI] Define the concrete `cargo xtask codegen` invocation for the G19 drift check · §0.4.5 · G19
  needs: P1.6.2, P1.26
  > **[!extern] (L(-1)):** registers the `bindings.ts` artifact (regen command + path + validator) in `scripts/check-generated-drift` (L(-1)) — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop skips it. Cleared once P1.6.2 + P1.26 land.
  > the named `cargo xtask codegen` command (regenerates `bindings.ts` → the P0 G19 framework calls THIS, not a guessed invocation) so the gate cannot silently pass on a stale file via a wrong command; the §06-owned drift check (authored P0.3.9) binds to it here.

## WebView app (React 19 / TS-strict / Tailwind / Vite)

The React 19 / TypeScript-strict / Tailwind / Vite frontend builds and mounts an
empty app inside the WebView — activating the P0 TS gate contract (G5/G6/G13) and
the per-push a11y leg (G33a) against real source.

  needs: P1.2
  > the Vite config building the WebView bundle Tauri loads, with the build target set to the §0.3.1 intersection of WebView2/WKWebView/WebKitGTK (no bleeding-edge CSS/JS that drifts); the `dev` server + `build` outputs `tauri dev`/`tauri build` consume.
- [x] **P1.30** [UI] Author `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript strict, no `any` · §5.1 §0.4.5 · G5 G6 G13
  needs: P1.2
  > the strict `tsconfig.json` (`strict: true`, `noImplicitAny`, the platform no-`any` rule) covering `src/**` incl. the generated `bindings.ts` — the project the P0 TS gates `tsc --noEmit` (G6 diff-scoped / G13 whole-project) act on (activates the P0.4.7 contract for the TS half).
- [x] **P1.31** [UI] Stand up `main.tsx` + `App.tsx` — React 19 root mount + empty screen-state router shell · §5.1 §5.2
  needs: P1.29, P1.30
  > the React 19 root mount (providers) + an `App.tsx` top-level shell that renders an empty/Idle placeholder — the minimal mounted UI the empty window shows; P1 lands only the router seam. **The §5.2 reducer FSM is built in P3 (the slice subset, P3.53) and completed to all 12 states in P4 (P4.80); the §5.1 Zustand shared store shell is P1.31.2 (body filled by P2.120's async wiring).** (The earlier "full §5.2 state machine is P2/P8" note was wrong: P2 builds only the §1.1 *intake* state machine + Rust contracts and P8 is chrome/polish — neither owns the §5.2 FSM.)
  - [x] **P1.31.1** [UI] Add the §5.1 Zustand shared-store dependency + the §0.8 pinned-floor JS supply-chain assertion · §5.1 §0.8 · G18c G18d

P1 lands the typed store shape + selectors as scaffolding (the §5.2 reducer FSM is the separate P3.53/P4.80 artifact that drives it); the live-progress wiring into the store + the `pendingVideoReencodeNote` population from `RunStarted.willReencode` are filled by P2.120's async model. Distinct from the Rust-side `tauri-plugin-store` prefs blob (P1.14/P2.85) — that is the 3-key `settings.json`, this is the in-memory frontend app store.

  > the flat ESLint config + stylelint carrying the project-local rules the P0.4.7 contract names (no `any`, the §6.4.2 `fc.gen()`-shrink-wrapper rule paired with P0 G9 invariant (f)) — the config the P0 G5 lint leg consumes; activates the eslint half of P0.4.7. (`needs: P1.35.1` for the `fast-check` dependency the project-local `fc.gen()` rule presupposes; the rule lints `fast-check` usage so the dep is its prerequisite even though P1.35.1 sits later in document order.)

  needs: P1.31

  - [x] **P1.35.1** [UI] Add the `fast-check` TS property-test dependency + its §0.8 pinned-floor JS supply-chain assertion · §6.4.2 §0.8 · G18c G18d

This is the dep the P0.5.2 property-test doctrine, the P0.3.10 G9 invariant (f) (`fc.gen(` shrink-wrapper ban), and the P1.33 project-local `fc.gen()` eslint rule all presuppose; without this box `fast-check` is referenced everywhere but installed by no box. Dependency only; the first TS property test that USES it carries `needs: P1.35.1`.
- [ ] **P1.36** [UI] Add the §5.1 lint rule enforcing the single-IPC-consumer boundary · §5.1 · G5
  needs: P1.33, P1.27
  > an ESLint rule (or config restriction) failing any `@tauri-apps/api` import outside `src/lib/ipc/**` — the §5.1 "exactly one IPC consumer" discipline the spec requires be lint-enforceable; runs in the P0 G5 lint leg.

## Strings module & a11y module shells

`src/strings/ui.ts` and the `a11y/` shells are established as structural
scaffolding (not deferred) per the README P1 scope — activating the P0 G57
English-only / string-ownership lint against a real `strings/ui.ts`.

- [ ] **P1.37** [UI] Stand up `src/strings/ui.ts` — the flat English UI-chrome string table (incl. the `idle_reassurance` §5.7 key) · §5.7 · G57
  needs: P1.31
  > the `strings/ui.ts` flat English key→value table (§5.7 ownership split: UI-chrome strings here, conversion-outcome strings owned by §02) — the module the P0 G57 lint asserts every key resolves to a non-empty English value over; activates G57 (P0.4.6) against a real target. No i18n runtime is added (the §5.7 by-construction Principle-11 enforcement). **Owns the `idle_reassurance` §5.7 named key** with its `[DECIDED]` fixed text `"All conversion happens locally, on your machine — nothing is ever uploaded."` as one of the module's initial keys (concrete-string treatment so the P0 G57 lint / drift check covers it — not free-form prose; validated by P9.10). **This is the SINGLE home of the key — P8.17 only REFERENCES it for the Idle empty-state, never re-defines it.**
- [ ] **P1.38** [UI] Assert no i18n-runtime / locale-switch import ships (Principle-11 by construction) · §5.7 §6.10 · G57
  needs: P1.37
  > the by-construction half of §5.7: no i18n framework / locale-negotiation / `Accept-Language`-driven selection is a dependency — the P0 G57 lint's "fail on any locale-switch/i18n-runtime import" leg; P1 establishes the no-i18n posture the gate enforces.
- [ ] **P1.39** [UI] Stand up `src/a11y/announcer.ts` — the §5.6 ARIA-live announcement helper shell · §5.6
  needs: P1.31
  > the `announcer.ts` interface-only helper (an ARIA-live region announcer) the §5.6 screen-reader path + later focus/announce wiring consume — established here as structural scaffolding per the README P1 scope; the per-component wiring is P4/P8.
- [ ] **P1.40** [UI] Stand up `src/a11y/keymap.ts` — the §5.10 canonical accelerator table shell · §5.10
  needs: P1.31
  > the `keymap.ts` single-source accelerator table (the §5.10 canonical map with `CmdOrCtrl` modifier handling) as a typed, mostly-empty table P5–P10 components reference rather than re-declaring shortcuts — established now so §5.10's "single source" rule holds from the first component.

## Governance docs, README & `.github/` templates

The §6.8 governance set + README download/trust skeleton + `.github/` templates
exist from the first commit (they gate contribution and have no build dependency);
the release-blocking governance-completeness GATE is P10, but the DOCS are authored
here.

- [ ] **P1.41** [DOC] Author `LICENSE` — MIT with the collective copyright notice · §6.8
  > MIT + the header `Copyright (c) 2026 Ne-IA and ConvertIA contributors` (inbound=outbound, no assignment) per the §6.8 table; the release gate (present + name matches §6.9 clearance) is P10.
- [ ] **P1.42** [DOC] Author `CONTRIBUTING.md` — inbound=outbound, no-CLA, optional DCO, the stated quality bar · §6.8
  > the §6.8 content: inbound=outbound under MIT, no CLA, optional `Signed-off-by` (requested not required), the inbound-warranty clause, how to run the §6.7.1 lanes, and the quality bar stated directly (no `any`/no `// TODO`/no `console.log` in prod/no inline CSS/production-ready) — NOT by reference to the private `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] **P1.43** [DOC] Author `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor-Covenant-class + enforcement contact · §6.8
  > a standard CoC with the SECURITY/maintainer enforcement contact per the §6.8 table.
- [ ] **P1.44** [DOC] Author `SECURITY.md` — private-advisory channel, untrusted-decoder scope, no-SLA posture · §6.8 §0.11 · G51
  > private vulnerability reporting (GitHub private advisories + contact), the scope statement (ConvertIA opens untrusted files through third-party decoders) referencing the §0.11 threat map + §2.12 isolation, the no-SLA best-effort patch posture, and how a reporter includes a redacted (§7.5) log repro; the public-prose typo gate (P0 G51) covers it. The §0.11 map back-reference is back-filled by P4's threat-map assembly (plan README fill-note) — P1 authors `SECURITY.md` with the reference present.
- [ ] **P1.45** [DOC] Author `PRIVACY.md` — offline restatement of §2.11 + the cloud-sync caveat · §6.8 §2.11 · G51
  > the plain-language §2.11 restatement (fully offline, no network/telemetry/accounts/update-phone-home; the only network is the user-initiated open-project-page) + the OneDrive/iCloud/Dropbox cloud-sync caveat per the §6.8 table; G51 typo-covered.
- [ ] **P1.46** [DOC] Author `TRADEMARK.md` — name/logo grant boundary + nominative use · §6.8 · G51
  > the §6.8 content: MIT covers code not the "ConvertIA" name / Ne-IA logo; forks must rename and may not use the logo; nominative-use guidelines. G51 typo-covered; the §6.9 name-clearance GATE is P10.
- [ ] **P1.47** [DOC] Author the `README.md` download/trust skeleton + per-platform prerequisite notes · §6.8 §6.2.4 §0.3.1 · G51
  > the README skeleton: what it is, canonical-GitHub-Releases-only download, the verify-your-hash recipe SLOT (the literal `minisign -Vm SHA256SUMS -p docs/minisign.pub` recipe is authored/filled in P10 §6.2.4), as-is/no-warranty + best-effort posture, the §0.3.1 supported-OS floor, the unsigned-build first-launch note, and the Windows portable-zip WebView2 + Linux AppImage `libfuse2` prerequisite notes (§6.2.4). Skeleton now; release-gated completeness is P10.
- [ ] **P1.48** [DOC] Author the `NOTICE` + `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` generated-file placeholders · §6.8 §6.3.2
  > the placeholder NOTICE / THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES files (marked generated-from-`engines.lock`+SBOM, never hand-drifted) so the §6.8 set is structurally complete from P1; per-engine rows are populated P5–P7 and finalized P10 (the release-blocking completeness gate is P10).
- [!extern] **P1.49** [CI] Author the `.github/` issue templates (default new-format requests to Future-Ideas-Parked) · §6.8
  > **[!extern] (L(-1)):** `.github/**` is L(-1)-caged — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop skips it.
  > the issue templates defaulting new-format/feature requests to **Future Ideas (Parked)** per the SSOT inclusion test (§6.8 `.github/` policy row); a `.github/` config change, gate-clean (actionlint/zizmor over any embedded workflow is the P0 G49/G50 plane).
- [!extern] **P1.50** [CI] Author the `.github/` PR template (DCO/quality-bar reference) + private-advisory config · §6.8
  > **[!extern] (L(-1)):** `.github/**` is L(-1)-caged — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop skips it.
  > the PR template referencing the DCO/quality bar + the private-advisory config wired to `SECURITY.md` (`.github/SECURITY` advisory routing) per the §6.8 table.

## Lane-A CI scaffold (per-push validation on `main`)

The §6.7.1 Lane-A per-push pipeline runs on every push to `main`, wiring the
lint/format/type-check/compile-sanity/audit steps + the 3-OS build into the P0 CI
skeleton (P0.2.4) and binding the now-real language gates to the P1-scaffolded
toolchain. Data-dependent guards (bijection §6.4.3a, defaults-registry §1.6) are
ADDED by the phase that produces their input — NOT here.

- [!extern] **P1.51** [CI] Author the Lane-A workflow shell wired into the P0 L4 skeleton · §6.7.1 · G25 G49 G56
  > **[!extern] (L(-1)):** `.github/workflows/**` is L(-1)-caged — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop skips it. The whole Lane-A CI cluster (P1.51–P1.61) is mine; cleared as its baubare prereqs land.
  > the `.github/workflows/` Lane-A workflow (push-on-`main` + fork-PR) plugged into the P0.2.4 clean-checkout matrix slot: top-level `permissions: contents: read`, per-job `timeout-minutes`, per-push `concurrency: {group, cancel-in-progress: true}`, SHA-pinned actions — the empty heavy-gate slots P0 left for P1 to fill; actionlint/zizmor-clean (P0 G49/G50). (No `needs:` on `dependabot.yml` — the workflow shell has no technical dependency on it; the logical "workflow exists before dependabot covers it" ordering is carried by P1.55's `needs: P1.51`.)
- [!extern] **P1.52** [CI] Wire the §6.7.1 step-1 lint/format legs (per-tool, gate-attributable) · §6.7.1 · G3 G4 G5 G6 G14
  needs: P1.51
  > **[!extern] (L(-1)):** `.github/workflows/**` is L(-1)-caged — Co-Pilot-authored under owner-ack (G71); the loop skips it (+ its sub-boxes .1–.3).
  > the Lane-A lint/format step decomposed into per-tool legs (each carrying only the gates it directly satisfies, so the first CI failure is attributable without log-diving): the Rust leg (.1), the JS/TS leg (.2), the YAML/config leg (.3). Each sub-box wires its leg into the P1.51 Lane-A shell; the parent is `[x]` only when all sub-boxes are (_format.md §2). Activates the CI wiring-point of P0.4.1 (Rust) / P0.4.7 (TS).
  - [ ] **P1.52.1** [CI] Wire the Rust lint/format leg (`cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy -D warnings` + the no-panic-sloppiness deny set) · §6.7.1 · G3 G4 G14
    > the Rust leg: `cargo fmt --check` (G3) + `cargo clippy -D warnings` with the no-panic-sloppiness/exhaustive-match deny set (G4 diff-scoped, full `--all-targets --all-features` at G14) bound to the P1-scaffolded core crate; a clippy regression is attributable here, independent of the JS leg.
  - [ ] **P1.52.2** [CI] Wire the JS/TS lint/format/type-check leg (`eslint` + `tsc --noEmit` + `prettier --check`) · §6.7.1 · G5 G6 G14
    > the JS/TS leg: `eslint` (flat config, the project-local no-`any`/`fc.gen()` rules) + `tsc --noEmit` (G6 diff-scoped, whole-project at G13/G14) + `prettier --check` (the G3 prettier leg over TS/CSS/JSON) bound to the P1 TS project; an eslint/tsc regression is attributable here.
  - [ ] **P1.52.3** [CI] Wire the YAML/config-hygiene leg (`yamllint` over `.github/`/config YAML) · §6.7.1
    > the YAML/config-hygiene leg: `yamllint` over the workflow + config YAML — distinct from the `actionlint` workflow-lint (P0 G49) and the `editorconfig-checker` EOL leg (P0 G52); it carries no Gnn of its own (a config-hygiene linter, not a catalogue gate), but it satisfies the at-least-one-ref rule via the §6.7.1 Lane-A home it wires into, so it carries `· §6.7.1` and is NOT `tooling-only` (a real ref and `tooling-only` are mutually exclusive, _format.md §3.1). A YAML drift is attributable here, never opaque behind the language gates.
- [!extern] **P1.53** [CI] Wire the §6.7.1 step-2 Rust↔TS type-drift check · §6.7.1 §0.4.5 · G19
  needs: P1.51, P1.28

  > the Lane-A step running `cargo xtask codegen` + `git diff --exit-code` on `bindings.ts` (the P1.28 invocation) — fails on stale generated types; the concrete activation of the P0 G19 framework (P0.3.9).

With **no `beforeBuildCommand`** in `tauri.conf.json`, the matrix step must run the Vite build (`pnpm build` over the `index.html` shell + the React mount → `../dist`) **before** `tauri build`, so the three frontend boxes are real prerequisites of the `tauri build` leg — added here rather than relied on by document order alone.)

## Gate-activation verification & contributor docs

The P0 `→ activated in P<n>` gates flip from skip-with-warning to fail-closed as P1
stands their targets up; this section proves the flip actually happened (no gate
silently stuck in its bootstrap skip state) and homes the contributor build-setup doc.

- [!extern] **P1.62** [GATE] Assert all P1-activated gates flipped to fail-CLOSED (grouping shell — a planted violation in each now-real target MUST fail its gate) · §6.7.1 · G24

  > the grouping parent closing the fail-open-until-activated loop: for each gate whose P0 box carries `→ activated in P1` and whose target P1 just stood up, run its **G24 negative self-test against the now-real target** — a planted violation MUST fail the gate, confirming it is **enforcing**, not stuck in its P0 bootstrap skip-with-warning state. Each gate (or closely-related cluster) is its own separately-faileable sub-box so a single failing gate's self-test is attributable in the build output (not opaque behind a 10-gate aggregate). Each sub-box records its flip in the existing `docs/process/gate-status.md` decision-log; the parent is `[x]` only when all sub-boxes are (_format.md §2). (The reverse `→ activated in P<n>` edges already exist on the P1 boxes; this box is the single owner that proves the activation closed the loop — mirrored as later phases produce gate targets, e.g. the P3–P7 format gates G22/G23.)

    > the P0.4.5 owner-decidable contracts (`cargo-acl`/cackle, Kani, `cargo-careful`, `cargo-geiger`) carry `→ activated in P1` but, unlike the fail-closed gates in .1–.9, are **informational-only in P0** (status tracked in `docs/process/gate-status.md`, plan-lint check 23) — so their activation is NOT a fail-closed planted-violation self-test but a **presence check** over the gate-status.md entries. **Tagged `[DOC]` (not `[GATE]`) + `· tooling-only` deliberately:** a `[GATE]` box must ship a G24 positive+negative self-test (a planted violation MUST fail it) registered for plan-lint check 16, but these four are informational-only so a "MUST fail" self-test does not apply — this box only ASSERTS the gate-status.md presence (a process-doc presence check, the `[DOC]` home), it does not build a guardrail. `[GATE]` + `tooling-only` would be a contradiction (a `[GATE]` carries a ref / a G24 self-test, `tooling-only` declares the absence of any ref), which plan-lint would fail on both reference-resolution and check 16; `[DOC]` + `tooling-only` is the correct, self-consistent pairing. The deliverable: assert `docs/process/gate-status.md` carries an initial `informational` entry (with a dated rationale) for each of the four, so the P0.4.5 activation is machine-verifiable rather than silently absent.

Gate-light (G51 public-prose typo only). (Alternative if local-bundle-build is out of v1 scope: an explicit `[DECIDED]` note recording that, rather than a silent absence — taken here as the doc, since the offline app is built locally by contributors.)

## Repository structure map & CLAUDE.md finalization

The complete repository folder structure is established and the authoritative
CLAUDE.md "Repo layout" map is authored at P1-end — the single home that says where
everything lives, and the target that flips the P0 G69 structural-map gate from its
P1 placeholder-stub skip to fail-closed. The final general CLAUDE.md accuracy pass
follows, now that the structure, the language gates and the governance docs are real.

- [!extern] **P1.64** [BUILD,DOC] Establish the complete repository folder structure + author the CLAUDE.md "Repo layout" map · §0.7 · G69 G24

P1.65 (`[ ]`, buildable) `needs:` this → the loop STOPs there at P1-end (the correct hand-back point for the L(-1) finalization).
  > the box that **activates the P0 G69 structural-map gate (P0.3.13)** by standing up its target. Three deliverables: **(0) RECONCILE §0.7 FIRST (the higher source).** Spec §0.7 "Physical tree" is the authoritative structural source per **SSOT > spec > docs**; the CLAUDE.md §1a map is its operational projection (G69 check 26 asserts §1a ⊆ §0.7). So **before** authoring §1a, reconcile the full intended P1–P11 directory set against §0.7 and, for any dir the product genuinely needs that §0.7 does not yet home (e.g. the dirs §0.7's current tree omits — `src/strings/`, `src/a11y/`, the engine-staging `bundle/`, top-level `design/`, `scripts/gate-selftests/`, `scripts/semgrep-rules/`, `fuzz/`, `.github/`), **add it to the §0.7 physical tree in the SAME commit** (the freshness rule, G68 check 25) — never let §1a invent a dir §0.7 does not list. **(1)** create EVERY directory the product needs across P1–P11 so no later phase silently invents an unmapped folder — the §0.7 physical tree completed beyond P1.1's scaffold: `src-tauri/` (+ its tier modules `src-tauri/src/{ipc,orchestrator,detection,engines,fs_guard,run,outcome,isolation,pool,domain,platform}`, `src-tauri/binaries/`, `src-tauri/resources/`, `src-tauri/icons/` P1.19.2, `src-tauri/capabilities/`), `src/` (+ `src/lib/ipc/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/state/`, `src/styles/`, `src/strings/`, `src/a11y/`), top-level `design/` (UI/design assets, a sibling of `src/` — the cleaner home than nesting under `src/`), the test dir(s) (`tests/`, `tests/corpus/`, `fuzz/corpus/`, `fuzz/crashes/`), the engine-staging tree (`bundle/` per the §6.1.3 stage-engines layout), `scripts/` (+ `scripts/gate-selftests/`, `scripts/semgrep-rules/`), `.github/` (+ `.github/workflows/`), `docs/` (exists), `assets/` (exists) — each with a `.gitkeep` where it must exist before its files land; **(2)** author the authoritative **CLAUDE.md "Repo layout" section** (the §0.7 projection) mapping EVERY directory → its purpose (replacing the standing placeholder map P1 ships from the first commit). This is the literal target the G69 bidirectional check (P0 build-gates §6 check 26) reads — once authored, G69 flips from skip-with-warning to fail-closed (the `→ activated in P1` flip, mirrored by P1.62 for the other P1-activated gates). **`needs:` the P1 scaffold boxes** so the structure being mapped already exists (P1.1 tree, P1.6/P1.6.1/P1.6.2 crates, P1.19.2 icons, P1.29/P1.35 frontend+test config, P1.51 `.github/workflows/`). Run the G69 G24 negative self-test against the now-real map (a planted on-disk dir absent from the map / a §1a dir absent from §0.7 MUST fail) and record the flip in `docs/process/gate-status.md` like P1.62's sub-boxes.

  needs: P1.64, P1.62, P1.44, P1.45, P1.46
  > a general accuracy/completeness pass over the WHOLE of `CLAUDE.md` now that the real structure (P1.64 map), the activated language + structural gates (P1.62/P1.64), and the governance docs (P1.42–P1.47) exist — assert every CLAUDE.md claim still holds against reality: the §3 architecture guardrails, the §5 anti-patterns (incl. the two standing rules — no unmapped folder / no doc drift), the §7 tech-stack pins, the §9 references all resolve, and the §1 "Repo layout" map (P1.64) is accurate. This is the doc-side companion to the P1.62 gate-activation verification: P1.62 proves the gates fail-closed, P1.65 proves the prose they enforce against is current. Runs the P0 G68 doc-graph integrity & freshness gate (P0.3.12) over the finalized `CLAUDE.md` — every cross-reference resolves, no orphan/stale claim survives. The owner's §10 own-rules block is NOT touched (CLAUDE.md §10 — Claude does not edit it without an explicit instruction).
