// §5.5 app-chrome a11y BASELINE — the per-push G33a (§6.4.6a) vitest-axe target over the mounted shell.
//
// [Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.122] SCOPE. The persistent app-chrome frame's VISIBLE content — the
// `AppHeader` banner (BrandLogo + ThemeToggle + About, §5.5) and the twelve §5.2 state screens — is owned by
// P3-P8 (P8.1-P8.3 build the header banner). So P2 (app-shell-contracts) establishes only the a11y baseline
// the shell exposes now and every subsequent screen inherits: the single `<main>` workspace landmark the
// state screens render into, zero axe ARIA/role violations, and roving-tabindex sanity. The banner landmark
// joins this baseline when P8.1 builds the `AppHeader`; each state screen adds its own axe assertions as it
// lands (the App.test.tsx / per-screen split). Rendering an empty banner region here would be premature P8
// chrome with an unfilled landmark, so the shell DOM is unchanged and this file is the enforced baseline
// contract (P1.35 wired the runner + P1.62.5 the armed canary; this box establishes the baseline they scan).
//
// App fires two §5.8 IPC mount effects (`useAppEvents`/`useLaunchDrain` — the P2.121 `useNativeDragDrop`
// interim is retired at P3.81, the DropZone owns the §5.4 DOM drag affordance); mock the §5.8 IPC façade so
// each a11y render stays hermetic — jsdom has no Tauri runtime, so the real Channel/invoke/listen throws. Each
// helper's behaviour is covered in `lib/ipc/events.test.ts`.
// The vitest-axe `toHaveNoViolations` matcher is not used — its 0.1.0 `.d.ts` re-exports the matcher type-only,
// which `verbatimModuleSyntax` rejects — so the assertions read the `axe()` result directly.
//
// [Build-Session-Entscheidung: P3.60] **This factory must export EVERY events-façade binding `App.tsx` imports —
// including module-SCOPE ones.** A `vi.mock` factory is strict: a missing export throws at import time
// ("No <x> export is defined on the … mock") and the whole file fails to COLLECT, so the miss reds this G33a leg
// (and the coverage leg) while `pnpm test` stays green — the a11y legs are `exclude`d from `vitest.config.ts` by
// design, so they cannot catch each other. P3.60's `APP_EVENT_HANDLERS` (App.tsx, module scope) made
// `consumeAppFault` the first such import and tripped exactly this. **The class:** a new façade import in
// `App.tsx` must be added to BOTH App mock factories (here + `App.test.tsx`) in the SAME commit — and a screen
// box must run `pnpm test:a11y`, not only `pnpm test`. (The sibling class: the P1.35/ee362ce mount-side-effect
// note — an IPC side effect at mount breaks a11y AND coverage; the fix is mocking the FAÇADE, isolation not
// suppression.)
