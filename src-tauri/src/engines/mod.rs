//! tier-3 → tier-2 edge is forbidden), `crate::ipc` is thin and DEFINES no DTOs (every C-return type is

// reads `EngineDescriptor.serialised_only` then, and `EngineId`'s wire registration rides the §7.2
// `EngineHealth` (C12) consumer (a later P2 box). So `EngineId`/`EngineKind`/`EngineDescriptor` are dead in
// the PRODUCTION build until consumed; the cfg(test) tests below construct them, so the TEST build is

// P2.98 wired the C11 `get_app_info` to assemble a real `Ok(AppInfo)` (`AppInfo::gather()` below), which
// constructs `Platform` via `current_platform()` (and `AppInfo` rides into `bindings.ts`); the P4
// `capabilities(platform)` consumers construct `Platform` further. `expect` (not `allow`) auto-flags the
