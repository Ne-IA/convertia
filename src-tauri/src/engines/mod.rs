//! P2.13 authors the §3.2 engine-seam descriptor TYPES here — `EngineId` / `EngineKind` /

//!
//! P3.4 additionally homes the §1.7 invocation-dispatch cluster + its transitively-embedded §3.2.2 plan-seam
//! hull (the P3.4 ↔ P4.2/P4.3/P4.6 reconcile): the `EngineInvocation` envelope + `InvocationResult` (§1.7),
//! the `Invocation`/`EngineProgram`/`StdinPlan`/`TempPath`/`PlanError`/`ProgressModel` plan-seam types
//! (§3.2.2 — `ProbeOutput` authored at P4.2), and the `dispatch` fn (the exhaustive `EngineProgram` routing). All
//! are core-INTERNAL (no `serde`/`specta`): the §1.9 FSM maps `InvocationResult` onto the wire `ErrorKind`
//! at P3.46, so nothing in this cluster crosses the IPC door.

// [Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.13] dead_code expect — the §3.2 seam descriptor types are authored as
// CONTRACTS before their consumers exist: the registry/selection is P4.4 (the full §3.2.2 `trait Engine`
// landed at P4.1 in `registry.rs`), the §0.9 pool
// reads `EngineDescriptor.serialised_only` then, and `EngineId`'s wire registration rides the §7.2
// `EngineHealth` (C12) consumer (a later P2 box). So `EngineId`/`EngineKind`/`EngineDescriptor` are dead in
// the PRODUCTION build until consumed; the cfg(test) tests below construct them, so the TEST build is
// dead-code-clean. P2.110/P2.111 added the §7.2.3 `EngineStatus` + `EngineHealth` wire DTOs; P2.113 wired the
// C12 `get_engine_health` return `Result<EngineHealth, IpcError>`, which REGISTERS the whole graph into
// `bindings.ts` — but its honest `Err` shell CONSTRUCTS neither, so they stay dead (fields never read) until
// the P4.45 startup probe assembles the real `Ok(EngineHealth)` (their wire-form tests below construct them,
// so the test build stays clean). The §3.2.2 `Platform` leaf (P2.132) + its `AppInfo` (P2.112) embedder are now LIVE:
// P2.98 wired the C11 `get_app_info` to assemble a real `Ok(AppInfo)` (`AppInfo::gather()` below), which
// constructs `Platform` via `current_platform()` (and `AppInfo` rides into `bindings.ts`); the P4
// `capabilities(platform)` consumers construct `Platform` further. `expect` (not `allow`) auto-flags the

The C12 get_engine_health return (P2.113) REGISTERS EngineStatus/EngineHealth into bindings.ts via its Result<EngineHealth, IpcError> signature, but its honest Err shell constructs neither, so their fields stay unread (dead) until the P4.45 probe assembles the real Ok(EngineHealth). AppInfo (P2.112) + the §3.2.2 Platform leaf (P2.132) are now LIVE — P2.98's C11 get_app_info assembles a real Ok(AppInfo) (AppInfo::gather()), constructing Platform via current_platform(); the P4 capabilities(platform) consumers construct Platform further.

The P3.41 §3.5.6 native transform (csv_tsv_transform / transform_bytes / CsvTsvTarget / TransformError / delimiter_byte) + its P3.44 cooperative-cancel TransformStatus + run_native_csv_tsv are WIRED by the P3.43 dispatch InProcessNative arm onto crate::pool::run_in_core but STAY dead in the production build until the P3.46 conductor makes dispatch a live root: rustc does NOT propagate liveness through a dead-but-present caller to its callees (a pub fn in a private module of a bin crate is not itself a root), so the whole InProcessNative chain (dispatch -> run_native_csv_tsv -> the transform + run_in_core) is dead until then. The P3.42 §3.5.6 CSV-injection literal-preservation checker (assert_injection_cells_preserved / InjectionCellNotPreserved) is dead until the P3.62 G32 corpus binding calls it over the injection fixture. The P4.2-authored §3.2.2 ProbeOutput (the parsed §3.2.1 probe result) is dead until the P4.9 probe-then-encode sequencing constructs it and a probe-engine plan_encode impl reads it (the P4.1 default impl ignores its _probe param by contract); its cfg(test) shape test constructs + reads all four fields, keeping the test build dead-code-clean. The P4.3-authored §3.2.2 leaf types (Direction / PatentDisposition / CodecPosture / EngineCapability + the SourceFmt/TargetFmt aliases) are NAMED by the P4.1 trait signatures (capabilities(platform, patents)) and the native engine's capability row, but their construction sites stay dead until the P4.4 registry calls capabilities() and the P4.40 engines.lock parse builds the disposition; their cfg(test) shape tests construct + read every field, keeping the test build dead-code-clean."

    // "test-covered, not prose"; `NATIVE_CSV_TSV_TIMEOUT`'s own doc names P3.61 as this sentinel's author.
    //
    // WHY A FIXTURE AND NOT ANOTHER `pending()` LANE: the sibling below already covers the mapping over a
    // synthetic lane. This one proves the reap over the code a real file actually drives — `csv_tsv_transform`
    // reading real bytes, on `Pool::run_in_core`, under `bounded_lane` — composed exactly as
    // `run_native_csv_tsv` composes it.
    //
    // WHY IT IS DETERMINISTIC (no stopwatch, no margin): the 120s production bound can never fire on SIZE — the
    // transform is a linear whole-file-buffered re-encode, so its real trigger is a stall, not a big file
    // (`NATIVE_CSV_TSV_TIMEOUT`'s doc says exactly this). So the sentinel STRUCTURALLY stalls: `should_cancel`
    // blocks on a channel whose sender this test holds, so the lane CANNOT complete inside any bound — the
    // `pending()` determinism argument, applied to the real transform. Dropping the sender at test end unblocks
    // the parked worker, so the abandoned thread exits rather than leaking.
    //
    // WHY THE FIXTURE'S SIZE IS LOAD-BEARING: `transform_bytes` gates `should_cancel` behind
    // `report_chunks = text_len >= PROGRESS_CHUNK_BYTES`, so a sub-100-KiB source is never polled and has NO
    // stall point at all. The sentinel is sized past that gate (106510 B, ASCII ⇒ decoded len == byte len; the
    // boundary is first reached by record 3200 at position 102414, with 128 records to spare). The control leg
    // below pins that this size is what arms it: the SAME stall closure over the 58-byte canonical fixture is
    // never polled, so that lane completes — a fixture-inertness tripwire that goes red the moment a shrunk
    // sentinel (or a raised PROGRESS_CHUNK_BYTES) stops crossing the gate.
    //
    // Stated precisely (the G1 opus P3): the ASSERTION is bound-independent — the parked lane can never
    // complete, so `EngineHang` is the only reachable outcome. What the pair of legs cannot separate is
    // ATTRIBUTION on a pathologically slow runner: `spawn_blocking` scheduling alone could outrun the 50 ms
    // bound, so a hypothetically-inert sentinel might still report EngineHang for an unrelated reason. The
