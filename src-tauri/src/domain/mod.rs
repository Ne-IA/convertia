    // example-based unit tests above. All three G16 / test-strategy §1.3 determinism knobs are set:
    //   * case-count floor 512 (> proptest's thin default of 256), via `ProptestConfig::with_cases`;
    //   * a PINNED CI seed — `pinned_runner()` drives a `TestRunner` with a `deterministic_rng`, so the 512
    //     cases are identical on every run, locally and in CI (the `proptest!` macro seeds from ENTROPY, so it
    //     CANNOT pin the forward seed — only an already-found counterexample; hence the explicit runner);
    //   * a failure is NEVER retried-to-pass — the pinned seed reproduces any counterexample deterministically
    //     (test-strategy §1.3 / §7). `Strategy`-combinator (macro-free) automatic shrinking, no hand-rolled
    //     `Shrink` impls (the §P0.5 / G16 rule).
