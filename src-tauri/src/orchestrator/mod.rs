//! `crate::orchestrator` — the §1.9 batch / job-lifecycle conductor: it builds the queue, drives
//! `JobState`, holds the run registry + cancellation tokens (§0.4.4), and fans progress out to the
//! Channel. It sequences the guarantees / engines / detection layers; it owns none of their behaviour.
//!
//! The conducting BEHAVIOUR (queue construction at C6, the §1.9 transitions, the run-registry WIRING +
//! the cancellation flow) is filled by P3.46. This module homes the §0.6 outcome-referencing lifecycle/result types
//! it assembles — `Batch`/`ConversionJob`/`JobState` (P2.10), the C4/C5 command-return DTOs
//! `PreflightVerdict`/`OutputPlanPreview`/`DestinationResolved` (P2.11), the §1.12 result types
//! `RunResult`/`ItemResult`/`Totals`/`CleanupResidue`/`ItemOutcome` (P2.12), and the §0.4.2 `ConversionEvent`
//! run-telemetry enum + its payloads `RunStarted`/`ItemStarted`/`ItemProgress`/`ItemFinished`/`BatchProgress`
//! (P2.37) — at tier 1, ABOVE the tier-3
//! `crate::domain` leaf, because each references `crate::outcome` (the §2.8 kind / `OutcomeMsg` / `IpcError`)
//! directly or transitively. Homing them here keeps the §0.6 `domain` ↔ `outcome` type cycle broken and
//! `crate::domain` a pure leaf (the §0.7 ‡ note, the owner-decided P2.10 tier-finalisation). The sibling
//! `JobStage` (no outcome ref) stays in `crate::domain`.
//!
//! It also homes the three §0.4.4 orchestrator-State stores (per §0.7, under the §0.7 "(§0.4.4)" umbrella) —
//! distinct from the outcome-referencing types above: the `RunRegistry` (the `RunId` → `CancellationToken`
//! run-cancellation-token store, P2.42; its register-at-C6 / cancel-at-C7 / drop-on-`RunFinished` WIRING is the
//! P3.46 conductor), its sibling the `RunResultStore` (the process-local terminal-`RunResult` retention for C8
//! re-serve, P2.43; no on-disk persistence per §7.4, its retain-at-`RunFinished` / evict-at-C6 / get-at-C8
//! WIRING likewise P3.46), and the `CollectedSetRegistry` (the `CollectedSetId` → `FrozenCollectedSet` resolve
//! store, P2.44; so the bare-`collectedSetId` C3/C4/C5/C6 commands resolve the frozen detection result without
//! a second walk, its register-at-C1/C2a-freeze / resolve-at-C3/C4/C5 / take-at-C6 WIRING likewise P3.46).

//   1. C4 is RE-CALLABLE at any point in state 4 (eager on the 3→4 transition, then debounced ~150 ms on
//      any target/option change, §5.8) — there is NO "fires exactly once" constraint.
//   2. C5 OWNS the destination: once the user changes it (a C5 on a `collectedSetId`), a subsequent C4 on
//      that same set CARRIES the C5-resolved destination in its `destination: DestinationChoice` argument
//      (caller-passed) and NEVER resets it. There is NO server-side destination store — the destination is
//      authoritative as the C6 argument (§0.4.1 C6 [DECIDED]); the "re-apply the retained C5 destination if
//      C4 arrives carrying a stale default" (§0.4.1) is a P3.46 runtime stale-default REPAIR, NOT a P2 state
//      structure.
//   3. C4 COMPUTES `rerun` (§2.5 equivalence) + the §1.10 `preflight`; C5 NEVER recomputes `rerun` (the v1
//      EquivKey is destination-independent, §2.5.1) — it CARRIES C4's `rerun` THROUGH UNCHANGED and
//      re-evaluates ONLY the destination-volume `preflight` (§2.14.4). This is the ONLY ordering rule.
//

// `DestinationChoice` field (C4 does not own the choice), and both carry the SAME `rerun: Option<RerunPrompt>`
// type (so C5 carries C4's `rerun` through unchanged). This is the same contract-here / behaviour-at-P3.46
