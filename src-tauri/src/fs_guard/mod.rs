//!  - `is_safe_output` — write-target link-safety vs the frozen source set (§2.3.3) — **P3.8**, the path-based
//!    verdict; the **P3.9** `open_verified_parent_dir` below roots the *write* at a verified handle.

// [Build-Session-Entscheidung: P2.74] The §2.3.1 resolved-identity TYPE only (option A "split IO-vs-pure",
// Co-Pilot 2026-06-30, owner-ratified): the `resolve_identity` FUNCTION that POPULATES it
// (`dunce::canonicalize` + the per-OS metadata read = IO, needs `dunce` and — on Windows — `winapi-util`
// for the safe `GetFileInformationByHandle` file-identity, both landed at P3.6) is wholly P3 — its
// contract-map entry at P3.1.1, its body at P3.6 — so there is NO half-built function shell and NO
// tagged-`Err` placeholder here (a placeholder with no honest value is the rejected quiet-stub, CLAUDE §5).
//
// Derive / identity choices (the §0.6 sibling types fix the house style):
//  - Core-INTERNAL: `FileIdentity` never crosses IPC — the §2.3.2 de-dup runs core-side and the wire
//    carries `DroppedItem.resolved_path` (§0.6), not this identity — so it derives NO `serde`/`specta`,
//    only `Debug` + `Clone` (it owns a `PathBuf`, hence NOT `Copy`), the internal-type set
//    `FrozenCollectedSet` / `Batch` use.
//  - `dev_or_volserial` / `inode_or_fileindex` are both `u64`: Unix `st_dev`/`st_ino` are `u64`; the Windows
//    `winapi-util` accessors `volume_serial_number()` / `file_index()` are BOTH already `u64` (0.1.11, no
//    widening — the std `MetadataExt` `Option<u32>`/`Option<u64>` forms are the nightly-gated ones we do NOT
//    use, §2.3.1). One platform-agnostic representation, so the TYPE carries no `cfg` — only its P3 producer
//    reads the per-OS metadata.
//  - `pub` fields, no constructor: a plain data record with no validation invariant (like `DroppedItem` /
//    `FrozenCollectedSet`), so P3's `resolve_identity` builds it by struct literal and the P2.76 pure
//    de-dup fold + the §6.4.1 unit tests construct `FileIdentity` values directly.
//  - `PartialEq`/`Eq`/`Hash` are HAND-WRITTEN over `(dev_or_volserial, inode_or_fileindex)` ONLY, NOT
//    `#[derive]`d over all three fields: §2.3.2 makes the (dev, inode)/file-index identity — "NOT the path
//    string" — the de-dup key, and §2.3.4 shows a HARDLINK is two distinct paths over ONE inode that
//    `canonicalize` cannot collapse (no link to follow), so the two `FileIdentity` values carry DIFFERENT
//    `canonical_path` but the SAME identity and MUST compare / hash equal to collapse to one frozen member
//    (§2.3.2 "converted once"). A blind `#[derive(Eq, Hash)]` would fold `canonical_path` into the key and
//    silently break hardlink de-dup. `canonical_path` is the §2.3.1 fast pre-filter + the §2.3.2 first-seen
//    representative path (and the §2.3.3 prefix-containment input), carried in the value, OUT of the key.
